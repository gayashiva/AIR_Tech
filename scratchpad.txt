Traditional AIR construction often involves regular increase in fountain height in steps of 1 $m$. These events
can trigger fountain freezing events by reducing the pipeline discharge to zero.

Fig. \ref{fig:radf} compares the temporal variation of the estimated spray radius with the measured spray radius
using Eqn. \ref{eqn:radf}. For the unscheduled fountain, estimated spray radius only assumes two values
throughout the study period. All the measured spray radius values lie between these two spray radius states of
the fountain. For the scheduled fountain, estimated spray radius shows high variations. The difference of the
estimated and the measured maximum spray radius is caused mainly due to underestimation of the pressure loss
since it increases as discharge rate increases, for example, during mid-december when spray radius reached a
maximum of 12 $m$. Therefore, if the spray radius estimation error during December is ignored, the maximum spray
radius of the remaining duration corresponds well with the observed spray radius.

\label{fig:radf}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Automation hardware}

The automation hardware consists of an AWS, flowmeter, control valve, drain valves, air valves, fountain,
pipeline and a logger. The logger feeds the AWS data to the automation software and informs the recommended
discharge rate to the flowmeter. The flowmeter adjusts the control valve to match the recommendation.

\subsubsection{Automation software}

However, the recommended discharge rate is ignored if any of the termination criterion are valid. The
termination criterion prevent water loss and fountain freezing events. In case a termination criteria is valid,
the drain and air valves allow the removal of water from the pipeline and entry of air in the pipeline
respectively.

Even though the number of drone flights were identical for both AIRs, fewer successful volume
observations were possible for the automated AIR as shown in Table \ref{tab:uav}. This was because the DEMs
generated for the automated AIR could not be used to georeference the snow covered surface of the automated
AIR. Since the traditional AIR was steeper, its surface revealed ice patches that could be georeferenced.

The automation system allows the easy handling of weather-sensitive fountain scheduling implementation in any
new location. The possibility for changing the location and fountain metadata directly in the user interface
allows tailoring the fountain discharge rate according to the location's water supply and weather conditions.
Our results suggest that the automation system was successful in operating fountains within favourable weather
windows while preventing the occurrence of any fountain freezing events. Although, the automation system
increases installation costs, we believe that use of such systems is warranted when considering the reduced
maintenance costs on a longer term.

We associate each energy turover with a sign equivalent to the sign of their mean energy flux during the study
period. A negative sign indicates that the corresponding energy flux increased or decreased freezing or melting
energy, respectively. Accordingly, the radiation fluxes contributed -6 \% and 5 \% to the freezing and melting
energies for the traditional and automated AIR, respectively.  Similarly, the turbulent fluxes for both the AIRs
contribute -9 \% to the freezing energies. The fountain discharge, rainwater and ground heat flux contribute 11
\% and 3 \% to the melting energies for the traditional and automated AIR, respectively. 

Both simulation and experimental results are available only for the CH22 MIV scheduled fountain. The simulated
value overestimated the maximum volume but was relatively successful in estimating the water-use efficiency of
the experiment.

Fig. \ref{fig:radf} compares the temporal variation of the estimated spray radius with the measured spray radius
using Eqn. \ref{eqn:radf}. For the unscheduled fountain, estimated spray radius only assumes two values
throughout the study period. All the measured spray radius values lie between these two spray radius states of
the fountain. For the scheduled fountain, estimated spray radius shows high variations. The difference of the
estimated and the measured maximum spray radius is caused mainly due to underestimation of the pressure loss
since it increases as discharge rate increases, for example, during mid-december when spray radius reached a
maximum of 12 $m$. Therefore, if the spray radius estimation error during December is ignored, the maximum spray
radius of the remaining duration corresponds well with the observed spray radius.

\label{fig:radf}
\end{figure*}

We evaluate the benefits of the automated construction strategies by comparing them with the traditional
construction strategies using the water-use efficiency and maximum volume metrics. The MIV and MWE models
were used to schedule the fountains of the simulated AIRs. These three kinds of fountain scheduling strategies
will be referred to as unscheduled, MIV and MWE fountain henceforth. 


\subsection{Applications of automated AIR technology}

The choice between using the traditional or the automated constructed strategy eventually comes down to the cost
involved. For both the construction strategy, pipeline length causes significant variations in the cost.
However, for the automated construction strategy, the additional cost of the automation hardware needs to be
considered.

The cost of the automation system excluding the pipelines was around 4500 USD for the CH22 experiment. This
included the cost of the weather station, logger box, flowmeter, control valves and air valves. This additional
cost is unaffordable for most AIR construction sites in operation now. However, in some cases, the benefits of
the automated construction strategy can justify this increased expenditure. Below we highlight some of these
cases.

\subsubsection{Ice reservoir irrigation networks}

The automation system can be integrated with drip irrigation networks in order to additionally reduce
distribution losses while irrigating plantations. This can be achieved by redirecting daily AIR meltwater into a
tank and connecting this with the drip irrigation pipeline and the automation system. In this way, the
automation system can be used for building ice reservoirs in winter and irrigating plantations in summer
efficiently.

\subsubsection{Sustaining AIRs perpetually}

Several constructions sites have been found where the weather conditions are conducive enough for AIRs to last
beyond a summer melt season. In such locations, automations systems can be a great resource for maintaining
these perpetual AIRs and provide supplementary water supply to the village throughout the year.

\subsubsection{Improvement of horizontal AIRs}

Even though we focus on just icestupas or vertical form of AIRs here, we believe the performance of horizontal
AIRs can also be increased by orders of magnitude with automation systems. Horizontal AIRs like basins, cascades
and diversions are still being used in Ladakh, India and show upto a 30 times increase in water storage capacity
compared to vertical AIRs \citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. However, the construction,
maintenance and location requirements of horizontal AIRs are prohibitive compared to vertical AIRs. But, through
integration of automation systems, horizontal AIRs can be scaled in volume and efficiency sufficiently in order
to justify these costs.

\subsubsection{Ice reservoir irrigation networks}

The automation system can be integrated with drip irrigation networks in order to additionally reduce
distribution losses while irrigating plantations. This can be achieved by redirecting daily AIR meltwater into a
tank and connecting this with the drip irrigation pipeline and the automation system. In this way, the
automation system can be used for building ice reservoirs in winter and irrigating plantations in summer
efficiently.

The maximum volume of IN21 is much higher than at the CH21 and CH22 AIRs due to the meteorological differences
between the two locations. Compared to the unscheduled fountains of each location, the maximum volume of 
scheduled fountains increases and decreases depending on whether the MIV or MWE fountain is used. 

\subsubsection{Reduction in maintenance costs}

Fig. \ref{fig:wue} (b) illustrates how the unscheduled IN21 fountain was interrupted several times by fountain
freezing events. Manual maintenance was required each time a fountain freezing event forced the discharge rate
to zero.

The automation system prevents fountain freezing events by avoiding discharge rates to lower below a minimum
threshold. As a consequence, additional maintenance due to fountain freezing events can be avoided in the
automated construction strategy.

\subsubsection{Operation of the automation system}

The automation software approximates the global solar radiation impact based on diurnal variation in February.
This caused the recommended discharge rate to be overestimated especially in the month of March and April
leading to discharge events that resulted in increased water loss.

\subsection{Model validation}

The model fails in estimating the expiry date of both AIRs due to underestimation of their melting rates. This
could be a consequence of our conical shape assumptions. In reality, AIR shape deviates from a cone especially
during the ablation period when the south face of the AIR melts much faster than the north face. Another cause
for the model error could be the deterioration of the albedo that is accelerated due to accumulation of
impurities on the surface as the AIR nears its expiry date.

\subsubsection{Controlling AIR shape through fountain characteristics}

CH22 experiment shows that two fountains with different aperture diameter but with the same water source produce
AIRs with different slopes. The average slope of the traditional AIR was higher than that of the automated one
due to the higher aperture diameter of the unscheduled fountain.  Fig. \ref{fig:radf} illustrates how the higher
aperture diameter of the unscheduled fountain resulted in a lower spray radius.  Therefore, under identical
weather conditions and with similar water source, fountains with higher aperture diameter produce ice cones with
higher slopes.


Here we define the critical
discharge rate ($Q_{crit}$) as the discharge rate beyond which fountain height increase triggers a fountain
freezing event. We refer to this height as the fountain freezing height henceforth.

The influence of the fountain height increase event on the maximum discharge rate was used to determine the
fountain aperture diameter and the critical discharge rate. The maximum discharge rate of the scheduled fountain
reduced from $Q_i$ =  13 $l/min$ to $Q_f$ = 11 $l/min$ when the fountain height was raised from  $h_i$ = 3 $m$
to $h_f$ = 4 $m$. Inputting the corresponding values in Eqn. \ref{eqn:bernoulli}, we get the estimated fountain
aperture diameter ($dia$) to be around 5 $mm$. 

The critical discharge required to increase the fountain height by one meter for the scheduled fountain with an
aperture diameter of 5 $mm$ was estimated from Eqn. \ref{eqn:bernoulli} as 5 $l/min$.

We define the fountain used through its five attributes, namely: spray radius ($r$), discharge rate ($Q$),
height ($h$), pressure loss ($P$), and water temperature ($T_F$). Spray radius denotes the observed ice radius
formed from the fountain water droplets. Discharge rate represents the discharge rate of the water in the
fountain pipeline. Height denotes the height of the fountain pipeline installed. Pressure loss denotes the loss
of water head caused due to the fountain nozzle . Fountain water temperature is the temperature of the water
droplets produced by the fountain.

Since the
automation system does not consume significant energy, it can be deployed in remote locations with solar panels.


Fountain height increase events also trigger fountain freezing events. This is because the higher the fountain
the lower the gravitational pressure that drives the discharge rate. This was why the fountain freezing event of
the unscheduled fountain was observed to occur almost immediately after the fountain height was increased.  

Fountain freezing events occur when discharge rate lowers below a minimum threshold. For the CH22 experiments,
this mimimum threshold was assumed to be 2 $l/min$. However, this value is site-specific since it depends on the
pipeline material used, water supply available and the temperature variations of the location.  Moreover,
favourable weather windows available for fountain spray are further reduced since the fountain pipelines need to
be operated above this minimum threshold.

However, minimum discharge rate has to be determined based on fountain spray observations.

Scheduling fountains manually is also challenging due to the diurnal variations in scheduled discharge rate.
This is highlighted by Fig. \ref{fig:wue} (b) where both the scheduling strategies require the fountain to be
switched on and off regularly. Moreover, fountain freezing events further complicate fountain scheduling. This

The model simulations revealed that the nonzero median scheduled fountain discharge rate at the IN21 and CH21
AIRs were 13 $l/min$ and 2 $l/min$, respectively.

Fig. \ref{fig:radf} (b) shows the estimated height of the traditional and automated AIR. The heights of both the
AIRs are underestimated since the model assumes a constant fountain spray radius for the whole study period.
This spray radius corresponds to the aperture diameter of the fountain whereas the height corresponds to  used as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:radf}
(a). 

Therefore, the traditional AIR had a lower spray radius and a higher height primarily because of its higher
fountain aperture diameter compared to the automated AIR.

This was expected since the fountain's spray radius and freezing height are both proportional to the discharge
rate according to Eqn. \ref{eqn:discharge}. This was also one reason why Swiss AIRs are much smaller than Indian
AIRs. However, in practice, indefinite increase in discharge does not produce indefinite increase in spray
radius since droplet accumulation around the fountain follows a normal distribution. Moreover, the fountain
pressure loss is expected to increase exponentially as discharge increases, further decreasing the expected
spray radius. Therefore, only limited control of height and radius of the AIR is possible using this strategy.

Both these strategies can be combined with fountain scheduling methods
to reduce watering volumes without affecting the water use efficiency and maximum ice volume obtained.

Typical solutions to maintain pipeline
water temperature given pipeline dimensions are to bury or drain the pipeline. Burying the pipeline at a
sufficient depth can reduce the influence of atmospheric conditions on the pipeline water temperature. Even
though this method is ideal, it can quickly get expensive depending on the length of the pipeline and the frost
depth. Therefore, such an effort is warranted only in the case of a permanent construction location.
Comparatively, draining the pipeline when the fountain is not active is a much cheaper strategy.

% \begin{equation}
%   0 = h + v \cdot sin \theta \cdot t - g\cdot t^2/2
% \end{equation}

From Eqn. \ref{eqn:discharge}, we get the fountain freezing height $h_{crit}$ to be proportional to both
the aperture diameter and the discharge rate as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:discharge}
  h_{crit} \propto \frac{Q_i^2}{dia^4}
\end{equation}

However, there is a large variability associated with this water supply due to the local weather influences and
discharge rate of the chosen location and fountain, respectively. 

Previous studies \citep{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022,
oerlemansBriefCommunicationGrowth2021} have already quantified the meteorological influences on AIR volume
evolution by comparing several AIRs built in India and Switzerland. 

Proper fountain scheduling requires answers to two main questions: 
(a) When should the water be turned on and off ?
(b) How much water should be sprayed ? 

Moreover, the Indian AIR discharge rate was lowered temporally due to increase in fountain
height from 5 to 9 m. Therefore, any reduction in initial discharge rate would have triggered a fountain
freezing event before the fountain height could be increased to 9 m.

This implies that the discharge rate was 11.6 $l/min$ (at 3.7 $m$ from 8th Dec), 10.5 $l/min$ (at 4.7 $m$ from
23rd Dec) and 9.2 $l/min$ (at 5.7 $m$ from 12th February).

Observations of the unscheduled fountain water droplets imply that its aperture diameter is likely to be larger
than that of the scheduled fountain. So lets assume that the unscheduled fountain's aperture diameter to be $x$
$mm$. Since we know the relationship between pressure loss and aperture diameter from \ref{sec}, we can convert
discharge rate measurements of the scheduled fountain to that of the unscheduled fountain with a given aperture
diameter $x$. However, we also know that this unscheduled fountain had a fountain freezing event at height 6.7
$m$. Therefore, the aperture diameter of the unscheduled fountain has to be 6 $mm$.

  \item Aperture diameter: The aperture diameter of the unscheduled fountain can now be determined using its
    fountain freezing event which happened at a height of 5.7 $m$. We assume that the discharge rate when the
    fountain freezing event happened was close to zero. According to Eqn. , the fountain freezing height for a
    given aperture diameter is unique. According to Eqn. , the discharge rate  

    Since the maximum discharge rates of the scheduled fountain with aperture diameter 5 $mm$ and
    height 4 $m$ is 11.3 $l/min$, the equivalent discharge rate is expected if the aperture diameter is
    increased by 1 $mm$ and its height is decreased by 18 $mm$ 

the water droplets cool to
0 C during their flight time under subzero conditions. Therefore, the fountain water temperature was instead
determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	T_{F} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		0 & \textit{ if } T_{a} < 0 \\
		T_{F} & \textit{ otherwise}
	\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

different estimations of the spray radius via the three methods for the scheduled fountain with $h_{max} = 4 m$,
$dia = 5 mm$ and critical discharge rate $Q_{crit} = 5 l/min$. 

Spray radius estimation can be carried out in three ways: (a) by measuring the spray radius in the construction
location; (b) by estimating spray radius from the fountain droplet projectile motion (see Appendix
\ref{sec:radf}); (c) by using spray radius observations from drone flights. However, methods (a) and (b) are
inaccurate since they ignore the effect of wind, snowfall, and refreezing events on the spray radius. Therefore
both these methods are likely to underestimate the spray radius. On the other hand, method (c)  depends on when
and how many drone flights were performed.

Fig. \ref{fig:radf} illustrates the estimated and measured spray radius using the projectile motion equation and
drone flights respectively. The maximum estimated spray radius corresponding to a fountain height of 3 $m$ and 4
$m$ is around 12 m and 5 m  respectively. However, the spray radius obtained from both methods (a) and (b) are
well below 6 m. This discrepancy is caused due to the increase in fountain pressure loss with discharge rate.
Since the fountain pressure loss was measured at a height of 4 $m$

The discharge rate of the automated AIR was scheduled by the automation system based on variations in
real-time weather parameters, height and several user-defined parameters discussed later. 
The discharge rate and water temperature of the scheduled fountain was measured by the automation system. Fig.
\ref{fig:aws} shows the temporal variation of the discharge rate produced by the automation system

\subsubsection{Fountain design}

Fountain design is an important area where improvement is necessary. In the case of the CH22 experiment, the
scheduled and the unscheduled fountain produced a spray radius of 4.8 $m$ and 4.1 $m$, respectively. The
scheduled fountain produced a higher spray radius because of its lower aperture diameter. However, we suspect
that the lower aperture diameter also resulted in a higher pressure loss. In summary, an optimised fountain
design needs to decrease the aperture diameter while maintaining a reasonable pressure loss so that a higher
spray radius is achieved. 

The engineering design of the nozzle used was approximated to a simplistic nozzle design with an aperture of
diameter $dia$ to understand its influence on the discharge rate $Q$.

% \begin{figure*}[t]
% \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/freezing_rate_corr.png}
% \caption{Scheduled discharge rate estimates of the simplified energy balance model with the WUE and ICV
% assumptions compared with the validated freezing rate of the full energy balance model.}
% \label{fig:freezing_rate}
% \end{figure*}

The last drone flight was used to set the dome volume for the traditional AIR. The
dome volume for the automated AIR represented the snow volume found before the fountain was switched on. The
remaining surveys were used for model validation.

A new fountain design was used for the
automated strategy since the traditional fountain design was unable to function in the whole range of discharge
rates suggested by the automation system.


Quantification of weather and fountain influences and improvement of these construction strategies, therefore,
will allow the farmers to cultivate larger areas or to devote more time to other activities. 

In order to circumvent these issues, AIR constructors often maintain the maximum possible flow in the pipeline
even during time periods when temperature conditions are far from ideal. This reduces the risk of pipeline
freezing events but at the expense of water use efficiency. However, AIR constructors also increase the fountain
periodically which lowers the discharge rate and thereby increases the risk of pipeline freezing events. Hence,
traditional AIR constructions often come to a halt in the middle of winter when increases in height and
fluctuations of weather inevitabily leads to a pipeline freezing event.

The automation system implements fountain scheduling strategies for the twin objectives of ice volume (ICV) and
water use efficiency (WUE). The ICV objective is suitable at locations with sufficient water volumes to freeze
during the construction period. The WUE objective is suitable at locations with favourable weather conditions
constrained by available water supply. For the ICV objective, the model assumptions overestimate the freezing
rate whereas for the WUE objective the model assumptions underestimate the freezing rate. 

But the surprisingly it also has a considerable influence on the energy
balance. The melting energy of the traditional AIR is increased due to increase in shortwave and fountain water
heat flux impact whereas the freezing energy is decreased due to longwave and latent energy difference. The
diurnal cycle of the growth rate is more pronounced in the traditional AIR because of the increased solar
radiation and decreased longwave radiation impact on the AIR surface. The main cause of the higher solar
radiation fountain water heat impact and lower longwave latent heat radiation is the dampening effect of
fountain discharge on the surface albedo and the surface temperature respectively. 


Given the excessive discharge rate of the unscheduled fountain, it is not surprising that its fountain
wastewater output is an order of magnitude higher than the scheduled fountain. But given the lower measured
volume of the traditional AIR, it is unexpected that it corresponds to a higher ice mass. This is because the
lower snowfall input of the traditional AIR made it more dense than the automated AIR (see Table \ref{tab:mb}). 

We performed the validation of the physical model on the two different AIRs using two different datasets namely,
AIR mean temperature and ice volume measurements. This was because there were fewer successful ice volume
measurements for the automated AIR due to lack of features on the snow covered structure. Meanwhile, the traditional
AIR being steeper exposed ice features that resulted in more ice volume measurements but it did not have a AIR
mean temperature dataset. Therefore, the calibrated physical model was tested using the hourly AIR mean temperature
measurements for the automated AIR and the ice volume measurements for the traditional AIR respectively. Root
mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient served as the evaluation metric in both the cases. Hourly
AIR mean temperature measurements were produced from the mean of all the six thermistor measurements located at the
interior of the AIR throughout the construction duration. Mean AIR temperature was estimated to be the modelled
average of surface temperature $T_{ice}$ and bulk temperature $T_{bulk}$. Ice volume was recorded using several
drone surveys as shown in Table \ref{tab:uav}.

Using the simplifications shown in Table \ref{tab:assumptions}, we can compute the expected freezing rate or
recommended discharge rates using the following set of equations:

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\label{eqn:T}
   \frac{q_{SW} + q_{LW} + q_{S}}{\rho_w \cdot L_F} + \frac{q_L}{\rho_w \cdot L_V} & \approx f(hod, T_a, RH,
   v_a) \\
		\label{eqn:auto}
  Q_{F} & \approx f(hod, T_a, RH, v_a) \cdot \pi r_{F}^2 \cdot
  \frac{1000}{60}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $r_F$ is the fountain spray radius, $Q_{F}$ is the discharge rate, f is the simplified energy balance
function and $hod$ is the hour of day.

However, in order to produce recommended discharge rates, we develop a simpler version of this energy balance
model that seeks a balance between model complexity and data availablity in order to produce recommended
discharge rates for the automation system.

This is because
it is challenging to optimise the pipeline and fountain charecteristics based on the high diurnal and seasonal
weather fluctuations during winter.
The
goal of fountain scheduling is to make the most efficient use of water by spraying the right amount of water at
the right time, making sure water is available when the AIR surface can freeze it.
Fountain scheduling methods are one option for reducing watering volumes for AIR construction systems. The goal
of fountain scheduling is to make the most efficient use of water by spraying the right amount of water at the
right time, making sure water is available when the AIR surface can freeze it. In order for this construction
method to also prevent pipeline freezing events, the pipeline needs to be additionally buried or operated under
periods of safe weather conditions. Burying the pipeline at a sufficient depth can reduce the influence of
atmospheric conditions on the pipeline water temperature. Even though this method is ideal, it can quickly get
expensive depending on the length of the pipeline. Therefore, such an effort is warranted only in the case of a
permanent construction location. Comparatively, draining the pipeline is a cheaper strategy but this requires
the quantification of real-time atmospheric influences in triggering such pipeline freezing events.  

\begin{equation}
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\Sigma(Q^{phy}_{F} - Q^{emp}_{F})^2}{\Sigma(Q^{phy}_{F} - \overline{{Q^{phy}_{F}}})^2}
\end{equation}

where $Q_{F}$ is the hourly freezing rate and the superscripts phy and emp refer to the physically and
empirically estimated freezing rates, respectively. The bar refers to the mean. The criterion has been used for
the evaluation of model performance in a wide range of hydrological studies
\citep[e.g.,][]{wilcoxPredictingRunoffRangeland1990}. An $R^2$ of 1 indicates perfect fit; $R^2<0$ indicates
that the average value of all observations is a better predictor than the model itself.

Proper fountain scheduling requires answers to two questions: (a) When should the water be turned on and off?
(b) How much water should be sprayed? Knowledge of surface freezing rates is important for answering these
questions. Surface freezing rates can be calculated by means of two different approaches: physical and
empirically based models. The former may be defined as a model in which each of the relevant energy fluxes at
the AIR surface is computed from physically based calculations using direct measurements of the necessary
meteorological variables, and the freezing rate is calculated as the sum of the individual fluxes scaled with
the AIR surface area during the accumulation period. The latter may be defined as a model in which the freezing
rate is calculated based on an assumed relationship with weather and location parameters. In order to produce
recommended discharge rates, empirical models are preferred due to their parsimony in data requirement and
computational time in comparison with the more sophisticated energy-balance models. But only physical energy
balance models exist for AIRs. Therefore, we develop an empirical model that seeks a balance between model
complexity and data availablity in order to produce recommended discharge rates for the automation system
efficiently.

\subsection{Model Update}
Besides the assumptions, the calculation of the fountain discharge heat flux was also updated. This update helps the
model better estimate the water temperature of the fontain droplets. In the previous model version, this water
temperature was assumed to be constant at 1.5 C. However, in reality, the water temperature depends on the
ambient air temperature. Under subzero conditions, the water droplets are likely to cool to 0 C duting their
flight time. Therefore, the fountain water temperature was instead determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	T_{F} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		0 & \textit{ if } T_{temp} < 0 \\
		T_{G} & \textit{ otherwise}
	\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

where $T_{G}$ is the measured or estimated ground temperature.

The model discussed in this paper will be applied worldwide
to identify favourable AIR locations in a future paper

\subsection{Implementation costs}

Since this technology is currently being used by subsistence farmers, we also need to be mindful of the
maintenance and implementation costs. We propose two different modes of fountain scheduling based on operation
costs that can be classified as static or dynamic. In the static mode, the total amount of water
for AIR construction is allocated without specifying its temporal distribution along the accumulation period. By
contrast, in the dynamic mode water is allocated at specific time steps along the accumulation period in
order to achieve even higher WUE.

Both the approaches use a fountain and pipeline system with minimal manual intervention. The dynamic mode is
better suited for locations where the diurnal and seasonal variations in the weather conditions are significant.
In such cases, the real-time adjustments of the discharge rate make efficient fountain scheduling
possible. The static mode is better suited for other locations or for users who cannot afford the additional
hardware requirements to implement the dynamic fountain scheduling mode.

Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) have recently received much attention in the light of increasing users,
especially in semi-arid and arid mountain regions facing limited water availability and at the same time
increased water needs. However, their water use efficiency is very poor.

%% Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:
%% Option 1: If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
%% They will be correctly named automatically.

%% Option 2: If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures

\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
