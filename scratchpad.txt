This is because
it is challenging to optimise the pipeline and fountain charecteristics based on the high diurnal and seasonal
weather fluctuations during winter.
The
goal of fountain scheduling is to make the most efficient use of water by spraying the right amount of water at
the right time, making sure water is available when the AIR surface can freeze it.
Fountain scheduling methods are one option for reducing watering volumes for AIR construction systems. The goal
of fountain scheduling is to make the most efficient use of water by spraying the right amount of water at the
right time, making sure water is available when the AIR surface can freeze it. In order for this construction
method to also prevent pipeline freezing events, the pipeline needs to be additionally buried or operated under
periods of safe weather conditions. Burying the pipeline at a sufficient depth can reduce the influence of
atmospheric conditions on the pipeline water temperature. Even though this method is ideal, it can quickly get
expensive depending on the length of the pipeline. Therefore, such an effort is warranted only in the case of a
permanent construction location. Comparatively, draining the pipeline is a cheaper strategy but this requires
the quantification of real-time atmospheric influences in triggering such pipeline freezing events.  

\begin{equation}
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\Sigma(Q^{phy}_{F} - Q^{emp}_{F})^2}{\Sigma(Q^{phy}_{F} - \overline{{Q^{phy}_{F}}})^2}
\end{equation}

where $Q_{F}$ is the hourly freezing rate and the superscripts phy and emp refer to the physically and
empirically estimated freezing rates, respectively. The bar refers to the mean. The criterion has been used for
the evaluation of model performance in a wide range of hydrological studies
\citep[e.g.,][]{wilcoxPredictingRunoffRangeland1990}. An $R^2$ of 1 indicates perfect fit; $R^2<0$ indicates
that the average value of all observations is a better predictor than the model itself.

Proper fountain scheduling requires answers to two questions: (a) When should the water be turned on and off?
(b) How much water should be sprayed? Knowledge of surface freezing rates is important for answering these
questions. Surface freezing rates can be calculated by means of two different approaches: physical and
empirically based models. The former may be defined as a model in which each of the relevant energy fluxes at
the AIR surface is computed from physically based calculations using direct measurements of the necessary
meteorological variables, and the freezing rate is calculated as the sum of the individual fluxes scaled with
the AIR surface area during the accumulation period. The latter may be defined as a model in which the freezing
rate is calculated based on an assumed relationship with weather and location parameters. In order to produce
recommended discharge rates, empirical models are preferred due to their parsimony in data requirement and
computational time in comparison with the more sophisticated energy-balance models. But only physical energy
balance models exist for AIRs. Therefore, we develop an empirical model that seeks a balance between model
complexity and data availablity in order to produce recommended discharge rates for the automation system
efficiently.

\subsection{Model Update}
Besides the assumptions, the calculation of the fountain discharge heat flux was also updated. This update helps the
model better estimate the water temperature of the fontain droplets. In the previous model version, this water
temperature was assumed to be constant at 1.5 C. However, in reality, the water temperature depends on the
ambient air temperature. Under subzero conditions, the water droplets are likely to cool to 0 C duting their
flight time. Therefore, the fountain water temperature was instead determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	T_{F} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		0 & \textit{ if } T_{temp} < 0 \\
		T_{G} & \textit{ otherwise}
	\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

where $T_{G}$ is the measured or estimated ground temperature.

The model discussed in this paper will be applied worldwide
to identify favourable AIR locations in a future paper

\subsection{Implementation costs}

Since this technology is currently being used by subsistence farmers, we also need to be mindful of the
maintenance and implementation costs. We propose two different modes of fountain scheduling based on operation
costs that can be classified as static or dynamic. In the static mode, the total amount of water
for AIR construction is allocated without specifying its temporal distribution along the accumulation period. By
contrast, in the dynamic mode water is allocated at specific time steps along the accumulation period in
order to achieve even higher WUE.

Both the approaches use a fountain and pipeline system with minimal manual intervention. The dynamic mode is
better suited for locations where the diurnal and seasonal variations in the weather conditions are significant.
In such cases, the real-time adjustments of the discharge rate make efficient fountain scheduling
possible. The static mode is better suited for other locations or for users who cannot afford the additional
hardware requirements to implement the dynamic fountain scheduling mode.

Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) have recently received much attention in the light of increasing users,
especially in semi-arid and arid mountain regions facing limited water availability and at the same time
increased water needs. However, their water use efficiency is very poor.
