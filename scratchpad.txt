Scheduling fountains manually is also challenging due to the diurnal variations in scheduled discharge rate.
This is highlighted by Fig. \ref{fig:wue} (b) where both the scheduling strategies require the fountain to be
switched on and off regularly. Moreover, fountain freezing events further complicate fountain scheduling. This

The model simulations revealed that the nonzero median scheduled fountain discharge rate at the IN21 and CH21
AIRs were 13 $l/min$ and 2 $l/min$, respectively.

Fig. \ref{fig:radf} (b) shows the estimated height of the traditional and automated AIR. The heights of both the
AIRs are underestimated since the model assumes a constant fountain spray radius for the whole study period.
This spray radius corresponds to the aperture diameter of the fountain whereas the height corresponds to  used as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:radf}
(a). 

Therefore, the traditional AIR had a lower spray radius and a higher height primarily because of its higher
fountain aperture diameter compared to the automated AIR.

This was expected since the fountain's spray radius and freezing height are both proportional to the discharge
rate according to Eqn. \ref{eqn:discharge}. This was also one reason why Swiss AIRs are much smaller than Indian
AIRs. However, in practice, indefinite increase in discharge does not produce indefinite increase in spray
radius since droplet accumulation around the fountain follows a normal distribution. Moreover, the fountain
pressure loss is expected to increase exponentially as discharge increases, further decreasing the expected
spray radius. Therefore, only limited control of height and radius of the AIR is possible using this strategy.

Both these strategies can be combined with fountain scheduling methods
to reduce watering volumes without affecting the water use efficiency and maximum ice volume obtained.

Typical solutions to maintain pipeline
water temperature given pipeline dimensions are to bury or drain the pipeline. Burying the pipeline at a
sufficient depth can reduce the influence of atmospheric conditions on the pipeline water temperature. Even
though this method is ideal, it can quickly get expensive depending on the length of the pipeline and the frost
depth. Therefore, such an effort is warranted only in the case of a permanent construction location.
Comparatively, draining the pipeline when the fountain is not active is a much cheaper strategy.

% \begin{equation}
%   0 = h + v \cdot sin \theta \cdot t - g\cdot t^2/2
% \end{equation}

From Eqn. \ref{eqn:discharge}, we get the fountain freezing height $h_{crit}$ to be proportional to both
the aperture diameter and the discharge rate as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:discharge}
  h_{crit} \propto \frac{Q_i^2}{dia^4}
\end{equation}

However, there is a large variability associated with this water supply due to the local weather influences and
discharge rate of the chosen location and fountain, respectively. 

Previous studies \citep{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022,
oerlemansBriefCommunicationGrowth2021} have already quantified the meteorological influences on AIR volume
evolution by comparing several AIRs built in India and Switzerland. 

Proper fountain scheduling requires answers to two main questions: 
(a) When should the water be turned on and off ?
(b) How much water should be sprayed ? 

Moreover, the Indian AIR discharge rate was lowered temporally due to increase in fountain
height from 5 to 9 m. Therefore, any reduction in initial discharge rate would have triggered a fountain
freezing event before the fountain height could be increased to 9 m.

This implies that the discharge rate was 11.6 $l/min$ (at 3.7 $m$ from 8th Dec), 10.5 $l/min$ (at 4.7 $m$ from
23rd Dec) and 9.2 $l/min$ (at 5.7 $m$ from 12th February).

Observations of the unscheduled fountain water droplets imply that its aperture diameter is likely to be larger
than that of the scheduled fountain. So lets assume that the unscheduled fountain's aperture diameter to be $x$
$mm$. Since we know the relationship between pressure loss and aperture diameter from \ref{sec}, we can convert
discharge rate measurements of the scheduled fountain to that of the unscheduled fountain with a given aperture
diameter $x$. However, we also know that this unscheduled fountain had a fountain freezing event at height 6.7
$m$. Therefore, the aperture diameter of the unscheduled fountain has to be 6 $mm$.

  \item Aperture diameter: The aperture diameter of the unscheduled fountain can now be determined using its
    fountain freezing event which happened at a height of 5.7 $m$. We assume that the discharge rate when the
    fountain freezing event happened was close to zero. According to Eqn. , the fountain freezing height for a
    given aperture diameter is unique. According to Eqn. , the discharge rate  

    Since the maximum discharge rates of the scheduled fountain with aperture diameter 5 $mm$ and
    height 4 $m$ is 11.3 $l/min$, the equivalent discharge rate is expected if the aperture diameter is
    increased by 1 $mm$ and its height is decreased by 18 $mm$ 

the water droplets cool to
0 C during their flight time under subzero conditions. Therefore, the fountain water temperature was instead
determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	T_{F} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		0 & \textit{ if } T_{a} < 0 \\
		T_{F} & \textit{ otherwise}
	\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

different estimations of the spray radius via the three methods for the scheduled fountain with $h_{max} = 4 m$,
$dia = 5 mm$ and critical discharge rate $Q_{crit} = 5 l/min$. 

Spray radius estimation can be carried out in three ways: (a) by measuring the spray radius in the construction
location; (b) by estimating spray radius from the fountain droplet projectile motion (see Appendix
\ref{sec:radf}); (c) by using spray radius observations from drone flights. However, methods (a) and (b) are
inaccurate since they ignore the effect of wind, snowfall, and refreezing events on the spray radius. Therefore
both these methods are likely to underestimate the spray radius. On the other hand, method (c)  depends on when
and how many drone flights were performed.

Fig. \ref{fig:radf} illustrates the estimated and measured spray radius using the projectile motion equation and
drone flights respectively. The maximum estimated spray radius corresponding to a fountain height of 3 $m$ and 4
$m$ is around 12 m and 5 m  respectively. However, the spray radius obtained from both methods (a) and (b) are
well below 6 m. This discrepancy is caused due to the increase in fountain pressure loss with discharge rate.
Since the fountain pressure loss was measured at a height of 4 $m$

The discharge rate of the automated AIR was scheduled by the automation system based on variations in
real-time weather parameters, height and several user-defined parameters discussed later. 
The discharge rate and water temperature of the scheduled fountain was measured by the automation system. Fig.
\ref{fig:aws} shows the temporal variation of the discharge rate produced by the automation system

\subsubsection{Fountain design}

Fountain design is an important area where improvement is necessary. In the case of the CH22 experiment, the
scheduled and the unscheduled fountain produced a spray radius of 4.8 $m$ and 4.1 $m$, respectively. The
scheduled fountain produced a higher spray radius because of its lower aperture diameter. However, we suspect
that the lower aperture diameter also resulted in a higher pressure loss. In summary, an optimised fountain
design needs to decrease the aperture diameter while maintaining a reasonable pressure loss so that a higher
spray radius is achieved. 

The engineering design of the nozzle used was approximated to a simplistic nozzle design with an aperture of
diameter $dia$ to understand its influence on the discharge rate $Q$.

% \begin{figure*}[t]
% \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/freezing_rate_corr.png}
% \caption{Scheduled discharge rate estimates of the simplified energy balance model with the WUE and ICV
% assumptions compared with the validated freezing rate of the full energy balance model.}
% \label{fig:freezing_rate}
% \end{figure*}

The last drone flight was used to set the dome volume for the traditional AIR. The
dome volume for the automated AIR represented the snow volume found before the fountain was switched on. The
remaining surveys were used for model validation.

A new fountain design was used for the
automated strategy since the traditional fountain design was unable to function in the whole range of discharge
rates suggested by the automation system.


Quantification of weather and fountain influences and improvement of these construction strategies, therefore,
will allow the farmers to cultivate larger areas or to devote more time to other activities. 

In order to circumvent these issues, AIR constructors often maintain the maximum possible flow in the pipeline
even during time periods when temperature conditions are far from ideal. This reduces the risk of pipeline
freezing events but at the expense of water use efficiency. However, AIR constructors also increase the fountain
periodically which lowers the discharge rate and thereby increases the risk of pipeline freezing events. Hence,
traditional AIR constructions often come to a halt in the middle of winter when increases in height and
fluctuations of weather inevitabily leads to a pipeline freezing event.

The automation system implements fountain scheduling strategies for the twin objectives of ice volume (ICV) and
water use efficiency (WUE). The ICV objective is suitable at locations with sufficient water volumes to freeze
during the construction period. The WUE objective is suitable at locations with favourable weather conditions
constrained by available water supply. For the ICV objective, the model assumptions overestimate the freezing
rate whereas for the WUE objective the model assumptions underestimate the freezing rate. 

But the surprisingly it also has a considerable influence on the energy
balance. The melting energy of the traditional AIR is increased due to increase in shortwave and fountain water
heat flux impact whereas the freezing energy is decreased due to longwave and latent energy difference. The
diurnal cycle of the growth rate is more pronounced in the traditional AIR because of the increased solar
radiation and decreased longwave radiation impact on the AIR surface. The main cause of the higher solar
radiation fountain water heat impact and lower longwave latent heat radiation is the dampening effect of
fountain discharge on the surface albedo and the surface temperature respectively. 


Given the excessive discharge rate of the unscheduled fountain, it is not surprising that its fountain
wastewater output is an order of magnitude higher than the scheduled fountain. But given the lower measured
volume of the traditional AIR, it is unexpected that it corresponds to a higher ice mass. This is because the
lower snowfall input of the traditional AIR made it more dense than the automated AIR (see Table \ref{tab:mb}). 

We performed the validation of the physical model on the two different AIRs using two different datasets namely,
AIR mean temperature and ice volume measurements. This was because there were fewer successful ice volume
measurements for the automated AIR due to lack of features on the snow covered structure. Meanwhile, the traditional
AIR being steeper exposed ice features that resulted in more ice volume measurements but it did not have a AIR
mean temperature dataset. Therefore, the calibrated physical model was tested using the hourly AIR mean temperature
measurements for the automated AIR and the ice volume measurements for the traditional AIR respectively. Root
mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient served as the evaluation metric in both the cases. Hourly
AIR mean temperature measurements were produced from the mean of all the six thermistor measurements located at the
interior of the AIR throughout the construction duration. Mean AIR temperature was estimated to be the modelled
average of surface temperature $T_{ice}$ and bulk temperature $T_{bulk}$. Ice volume was recorded using several
drone surveys as shown in Table \ref{tab:uav}.

Using the simplifications shown in Table \ref{tab:assumptions}, we can compute the expected freezing rate or
recommended discharge rates using the following set of equations:

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\label{eqn:T}
   \frac{q_{SW} + q_{LW} + q_{S}}{\rho_w \cdot L_F} + \frac{q_L}{\rho_w \cdot L_V} & \approx f(hod, T_a, RH,
   v_a) \\
		\label{eqn:auto}
  Q_{F} & \approx f(hod, T_a, RH, v_a) \cdot \pi r_{F}^2 \cdot
  \frac{1000}{60}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $r_F$ is the fountain spray radius, $Q_{F}$ is the discharge rate, f is the simplified energy balance
function and $hod$ is the hour of day.

However, in order to produce recommended discharge rates, we develop a simpler version of this energy balance
model that seeks a balance between model complexity and data availablity in order to produce recommended
discharge rates for the automation system.

This is because
it is challenging to optimise the pipeline and fountain charecteristics based on the high diurnal and seasonal
weather fluctuations during winter.
The
goal of fountain scheduling is to make the most efficient use of water by spraying the right amount of water at
the right time, making sure water is available when the AIR surface can freeze it.
Fountain scheduling methods are one option for reducing watering volumes for AIR construction systems. The goal
of fountain scheduling is to make the most efficient use of water by spraying the right amount of water at the
right time, making sure water is available when the AIR surface can freeze it. In order for this construction
method to also prevent pipeline freezing events, the pipeline needs to be additionally buried or operated under
periods of safe weather conditions. Burying the pipeline at a sufficient depth can reduce the influence of
atmospheric conditions on the pipeline water temperature. Even though this method is ideal, it can quickly get
expensive depending on the length of the pipeline. Therefore, such an effort is warranted only in the case of a
permanent construction location. Comparatively, draining the pipeline is a cheaper strategy but this requires
the quantification of real-time atmospheric influences in triggering such pipeline freezing events.  

\begin{equation}
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\Sigma(Q^{phy}_{F} - Q^{emp}_{F})^2}{\Sigma(Q^{phy}_{F} - \overline{{Q^{phy}_{F}}})^2}
\end{equation}

where $Q_{F}$ is the hourly freezing rate and the superscripts phy and emp refer to the physically and
empirically estimated freezing rates, respectively. The bar refers to the mean. The criterion has been used for
the evaluation of model performance in a wide range of hydrological studies
\citep[e.g.,][]{wilcoxPredictingRunoffRangeland1990}. An $R^2$ of 1 indicates perfect fit; $R^2<0$ indicates
that the average value of all observations is a better predictor than the model itself.

Proper fountain scheduling requires answers to two questions: (a) When should the water be turned on and off?
(b) How much water should be sprayed? Knowledge of surface freezing rates is important for answering these
questions. Surface freezing rates can be calculated by means of two different approaches: physical and
empirically based models. The former may be defined as a model in which each of the relevant energy fluxes at
the AIR surface is computed from physically based calculations using direct measurements of the necessary
meteorological variables, and the freezing rate is calculated as the sum of the individual fluxes scaled with
the AIR surface area during the accumulation period. The latter may be defined as a model in which the freezing
rate is calculated based on an assumed relationship with weather and location parameters. In order to produce
recommended discharge rates, empirical models are preferred due to their parsimony in data requirement and
computational time in comparison with the more sophisticated energy-balance models. But only physical energy
balance models exist for AIRs. Therefore, we develop an empirical model that seeks a balance between model
complexity and data availablity in order to produce recommended discharge rates for the automation system
efficiently.

\subsection{Model Update}
Besides the assumptions, the calculation of the fountain discharge heat flux was also updated. This update helps the
model better estimate the water temperature of the fontain droplets. In the previous model version, this water
temperature was assumed to be constant at 1.5 C. However, in reality, the water temperature depends on the
ambient air temperature. Under subzero conditions, the water droplets are likely to cool to 0 C duting their
flight time. Therefore, the fountain water temperature was instead determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	T_{F} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		0 & \textit{ if } T_{temp} < 0 \\
		T_{G} & \textit{ otherwise}
	\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

where $T_{G}$ is the measured or estimated ground temperature.

The model discussed in this paper will be applied worldwide
to identify favourable AIR locations in a future paper

\subsection{Implementation costs}

Since this technology is currently being used by subsistence farmers, we also need to be mindful of the
maintenance and implementation costs. We propose two different modes of fountain scheduling based on operation
costs that can be classified as static or dynamic. In the static mode, the total amount of water
for AIR construction is allocated without specifying its temporal distribution along the accumulation period. By
contrast, in the dynamic mode water is allocated at specific time steps along the accumulation period in
order to achieve even higher WUE.

Both the approaches use a fountain and pipeline system with minimal manual intervention. The dynamic mode is
better suited for locations where the diurnal and seasonal variations in the weather conditions are significant.
In such cases, the real-time adjustments of the discharge rate make efficient fountain scheduling
possible. The static mode is better suited for other locations or for users who cannot afford the additional
hardware requirements to implement the dynamic fountain scheduling mode.

Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) have recently received much attention in the light of increasing users,
especially in semi-arid and arid mountain regions facing limited water availability and at the same time
increased water needs. However, their water use efficiency is very poor.
