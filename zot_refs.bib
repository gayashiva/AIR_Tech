  abstract = {Center pivot systems are widely used to overcome the irrigation needs of agricultural fields. In this paper, an autonomous approach is proposed in order to improve the low efficiency of irrigation by developing a system based on the water requirement of the plantations, through field data. The data are local temperature, local wind, soil moisture, precipitation forecast, and soil evapotranspiration calculation. This information enables the system to calculate the real evapotranspiration for not being necessary to restrict to lysimetric measures. By this way, the system schedules the irrigation for the lower cost periods, considering the produced energy by the local resources, and the price of energy purchased from the utility grid. Also, it is considered that the irrigation must be carried out within the time interval in which the plantations do not reach the wilding point, so it will be carried out at the periods with the lowest cost. This will optimize the overall operational costs of the irrigation.},

  abstract = {Since 2014, mountain communities in Ladakh, India have been constructing dozens of Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) by spraying water through fountain systems every winter. The meltwater from these structures is crucial to meet irrigation water demands during spring. However, there is a large variability associated with this water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen location. This study compared the ice volume evolution of an AIR built in Ladakh, India with two others built in Guttannen, Switzerland using a surface energy balance model. Model input consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain discharge rate (mass input of an AIR). Model calibration and validation were completed using ice volume and surface area measurements taken from several drone surveys. The model was successful in estimating the observed ice volume evolution with a root mean square error within 18               \%               of the maximum ice volume for all the AIRs. The location in Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four times larger compared to the Guttannen site. However, the corresponding water losses for all the AIRs were more than three-quarters of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain wastewater. Drier and colder locations in relatively cloud-free regions are expected to produce long-lasting AIRs with higher maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain regions, where AIR technology could provide a relatively affordable and sustainable strategy to mitigate climate change induced water stress.},

  abstract = {Microirrigation techniques can be used to improve irrigation efficiency on vegetable gardens by reducing soil evaporation and drainage losses and by creating and maintaining soil moisture conditions that are favourable to crop growth. Water balance experiments in Zimbabwe showed that over 50\% of the water applied as surface irrigation on traditional irrigated gardens can be lost as soil evaporation. This result gives an indication of the potential improvement in irrigation efficiency that can be achieved by adopting irrigation methods that reduce soil evaporation at the same time as minimising losses due to drainage and canopy interception. During the period 1985 to 1995, irrigation trials and experiments were carried out in south-east Zimbabwe and northern Sri Lanka with the main aim of comparing and quantifying the benefits of using simple microirrigation techniques on traditional vegetable gardens. This paper reviews the results of these trials and experiments. Microirrigation techniques that were evaluated included low-head drip irrigation, pitcher irrigation and subsurface irrigation using clay pipes. Of these methods, subsurface irrigation using clay pipes was found to be particularly effective in improving yields, crop quality and water use efficiency as well as being cheap, simple and easy to use. The comparative advantages of subsurface irrigation were maintained for a range of crops grown under different climatic conditions. Good results were also obtained with subsurface irrigation when irrigation was carried out using with poor quality irrigation water.},

  abstract = {To support improved irrigation scheduling in the Syr Darya basin, Uzbekistan, the ISAREG model was selected due to previous applications in similar climates. It is a conceptual non-distributed water balance model for simulating crop irrigation schedules at field level and to compute irrigation requirements under optimal and/or water stressed conditions. To provide for the use of the model at the project scale, a new version of the model, integrated with a Geographical Information System (GIS), was developed. This GIS based application is aimed at supporting the implementation of improved farm irrigation management and, in a later phase, to also help project management. The integration concerns the creation of spatial and weather GIS databases usable by ISAREG, the models operation for different water management scenarios, and the production of crop irrigation maps and time dependent irrigation depths at selected aggregation modes, including the farm scale. The resulting information on alternative irrigation schedules is, therefore, spatially distributed and shall be used both to support irrigation scheduling advising and to help in the identification of practices that may lead to water saving and provide for salinity control. The paper includes brief descriptions of the models, the databases and the integration of the models, as well as main features of the GISAREG application. Results relative to the comparative analysis of irrigation scheduling scenarios show the capabilities of the model to support the selection of water saving alternatives. The appropriateness of implementing 15\textendash 20-day time intervals between irrigations is shown. In addition, results relative to compare net irrigation requirements for wet and dry years show the usefulness of the model in handling time series of weather data.},

The models range from a simple degree-day model, based solely on air temperature, to more-sophisticated models, including the full shortwave radiation balance. In addition to the empirical models, the performance of a physically based energy-balance (EB) model is examined. The melt models are coupled to an accumulation and a surface evolution model and applied in a distributed manner to Rhonegletscher, Switzerland, over the period 1929\textendash 2012 at hourly resolution. For calibration, seasonal mass-balance measurements (2006\textendash 12) are used. Decadal ice volume changes for six periods in the years 1929\textendash 2012 serve for model validation. Over the period 2006\textendash 12, there are almost no differences in performance between the models, except for EB, which is less consistent with observations, likely due to lack of meteorological in situ data. However, simulations over the long term (1929\textendash 2012) reveal that models which include a separate term for shortwave radiation agree best with the observed ice volume changes, indicating that their melt relationships are robust in time and thus suitable for long-term modelling, in contrast to more empirical approaches that are oversensitive to temperature fluctuations.},

  abstract = {In semiarid regions where water resources are scarce, irrigation water use efficiency is an important issue. Although subsurface drip irrigation is a very efficient irrigation method, it has had relatively limited expansion due to several disadvantages such as the clogging of emitters and the difficulty of detecting leakages and repairing them. Recently, an alternative subsurface irrigation method that is able to avoid most of the aforementioned drawbacks has been introduced in southern Spain. The objective of this work is to assess the performance of this method and to compare it to a surface drip-irrigation system. To achieve this objective, a three-year field experiment was carried out in an organic olive orchard (Olea europaea L.) located in the province of Almer\'ia, Spain. The water-use efficiency of both irrigation methods was analyzed under three different irrigation water supplies. The results show that the alternative subsurface irrigation method seems to perform better than the drip irrigation one because the yield and the irrigation water use efficiency were higher for the first one.

  abstract = {To sustain productive irrigated agriculture with limited water resources requires a high water use efficiency. This can be achieved by the precise scheduling of deficit irrigation systems taking into account the crops' response to water stress at different stages of plant growth. Particularly in the light of climate change with rising population numbers and increasing water scarcity, an optimal solution for this task is of paramount importance. We solve the corresponding complex multidimensional and nonlinear optimization problem, i.e., finding the ideal schedule for maximum crop yield with a given water volume by a well tailored approach which offers straightforward application facilities. A global optimization technique allows, together with physically based modeling, for the risk assessment in yield reduction considering different sources of uncertainty (e.g., climate, soil conditions, and management). A new stochastic framework for decision support is developed which aims at optimal climate change adaption strategies in irrigation. It consists of: (1) a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate change; (2) a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply; and (3) mechanistic models for rigorously simulating water transport and crop growth. The result, namely, stochastic crop-water production functions, allows to assess the impact of climate variability on potential yield and thus provides a valuable tool for estimating minimum water demands for irrigation in water resources planning and management, assisting furthermore in generating maps of yield uncertainty for specific crops and specific agricultural areas. The tool is successfully applied at an experimental site in southern France. The impacts of predicted climate variability on maize are discussed.},

However, many of the available guidelines for sensor placement were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. Sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting irrigation efficiency. This study investigates how soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems under various conditions. For this purpose several numerical experiments were carried out using a mathematical model, incorporating a system-dependent boundary condition in order to simulate soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems. The results of this study provided clear evidence that soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation efficiency in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. In specific cases the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was as high as 16\%; however, when nearby sensor positions were examined, the observed differences were generally low. The effect of sensors accuracy was even clearer. For the lower sensor's error level studied ({$\pm$}0.01cm3cm-3) the effect on irrigation efficiency ranged between 2.5\% and 6.4\%, while for the higher error level ({$\pm$}0.03cm3cm-3) the effect ranged between 10.2\% and 18.7\%. These results highlight the importance of a detailed study taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation, and scheduling systems as well as soil moisture sensors in order to provide a sound basis for improved irrigation scheduling. The need for soil specific calibration of the sensors used in such systems is highlighted as well. Lastly, a significant outcome of this study is the ability of computer models to serve as efficient tools for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning and accuracy, or other automated scheduling system characteristics.},
