  abstract = {Center pivot systems are widely used to overcome the irrigation needs of agricultural fields. In this paper, an autonomous approach is proposed in order to improve the low efficiency of irrigation by developing a system based on the water requirement of the plantations, through field data. The data are local temperature, local wind, soil moisture, precipitation forecast, and soil evapotranspiration calculation. This information enables the system to calculate the real evapotranspiration for not being necessary to restrict to lysimetric measures. By this way, the system schedules the irrigation for the lower cost periods, considering the produced energy by the local resources, and the price of energy purchased from the utility grid. Also, it is considered that the irrigation must be carried out within the time interval in which the plantations do not reach the wilding point, so it will be carried out at the periods with the lowest cost. This will optimize the overall operational costs of the irrigation.},

  abstract = {Since 2014, mountain communities in Ladakh, India have been constructing dozens of Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) by spraying water through fountain systems every winter. The meltwater from these structures is crucial to meet irrigation water demands during spring. However, there is a large variability associated with this water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen location. This study compared the ice volume evolution of an AIR built in Ladakh, India with two others built in Guttannen, Switzerland using a surface energy balance model. Model input consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain discharge rate (mass input of an AIR). Model calibration and validation were completed using ice volume and surface area measurements taken from several drone surveys. The model was successful in estimating the observed ice volume evolution with a root mean square error within 18               \%               of the maximum ice volume for all the AIRs. The location in Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four times larger compared to the Guttannen site. However, the corresponding water losses for all the AIRs were more than three-quarters of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain wastewater. Drier and colder locations in relatively cloud-free regions are expected to produce long-lasting AIRs with higher maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain regions, where AIR technology could provide a relatively affordable and sustainable strategy to mitigate climate change induced water stress.},

  abstract = {To support improved irrigation scheduling in the Syr Darya basin, Uzbekistan, the ISAREG model was selected due to previous applications in similar climates. It is a conceptual non-distributed water balance model for simulating crop irrigation schedules at field level and to compute irrigation requirements under optimal and/or water stressed conditions. To provide for the use of the model at the project scale, a new version of the model, integrated with a Geographical Information System (GIS), was developed. This GIS based application is aimed at supporting the implementation of improved farm irrigation management and, in a later phase, to also help project management. The integration concerns the creation of spatial and weather GIS databases usable by ISAREG, the models operation for different water management scenarios, and the production of crop irrigation maps and time dependent irrigation depths at selected aggregation modes, including the farm scale. The resulting information on alternative irrigation schedules is, therefore, spatially distributed and shall be used both to support irrigation scheduling advising and to help in the identification of practices that may lead to water saving and provide for salinity control. The paper includes brief descriptions of the models, the databases and the integration of the models, as well as main features of the GISAREG application. Results relative to the comparative analysis of irrigation scheduling scenarios show the capabilities of the model to support the selection of water saving alternatives. The appropriateness of implementing 15\textendash 20-day time intervals between irrigations is shown. In addition, results relative to compare net irrigation requirements for wet and dry years show the usefulness of the model in handling time series of weather data.},

The models range from a simple degree-day model, based solely on air temperature, to more-sophisticated models, including the full shortwave radiation balance. In addition to the empirical models, the performance of a physically based energy-balance (EB) model is examined. The melt models are coupled to an accumulation and a surface evolution model and applied in a distributed manner to Rhonegletscher, Switzerland, over the period 1929\textendash 2012 at hourly resolution. For calibration, seasonal mass-balance measurements (2006\textendash 12) are used. Decadal ice volume changes for six periods in the years 1929\textendash 2012 serve for model validation. Over the period 2006\textendash 12, there are almost no differences in performance between the models, except for EB, which is less consistent with observations, likely due to lack of meteorological in situ data. However, simulations over the long term (1929\textendash 2012) reveal that models which include a separate term for shortwave radiation agree best with the observed ice volume changes, indicating that their melt relationships are robust in time and thus suitable for long-term modelling, in contrast to more empirical approaches that are oversensitive to temperature fluctuations.},

  abstract = {The optimal utilization of solar energy requires a thorough characterization of the solar resource. The most accurate way is to measure that resource in situ. However accurate measurements are not a common commodity, especially over longer time spans. To circumvent the lack of ground based measurements, models can be applied to estimate solar irradiance components. A fundamental component is clear sky irradiance. In particular, clear sky irradiance is used as the normalization function in models that convert meteorological satellite images into irradiance, or in models that decompose global irradiance into diffuse/direct fraction. It is therefore important to evaluate and validate clear sky irradiance models. This paper presents the results of a validation of hourly clear sky models spanning up to eight years. The validation relies on high quality measurements at 22 locations in Europe and around the Mediterranean region. Seven models are evaluated. They were selected on the basis of their published performance, their simplicity of use, and/or their computational speed; two different sources of the aerosol load are used as input to the models. The three best models show a low bias and a standard deviation ranging from {$\pm$}3\% to {$\pm$}5\%. The standard deviation of the bias across the 22 locations is of the same order of magnitude. The observed bias patterns can be largely traced to inaccuracies inherent to the sources aerosol optical depth. No particular seasonal effects are noted. A consistent limitation across all selected models, even if their direct irradiance performance can be judged satisfactory based on the standard deviation metric, is that they tend to fall short of observations for a given clear sky global clearness index value.},

  abstract = {In semiarid regions where water resources are scarce, irrigation water use efficiency is an important issue. Although subsurface drip irrigation is a very efficient irrigation method, it has had relatively limited expansion due to several disadvantages such as the clogging of emitters and the difficulty of detecting leakages and repairing them. Recently, an alternative subsurface irrigation method that is able to avoid most of the aforementioned drawbacks has been introduced in southern Spain. The objective of this work is to assess the performance of this method and to compare it to a surface drip-irrigation system. To achieve this objective, a three-year field experiment was carried out in an organic olive orchard (Olea europaea L.) located in the province of Almer\'ia, Spain. The water-use efficiency of both irrigation methods was analyzed under three different irrigation water supplies. The results show that the alternative subsurface irrigation method seems to perform better than the drip irrigation one because the yield and the irrigation water use efficiency were higher for the first one.

This can be achieved by the precise scheduling of deficit irrigation systems taking into account the crops' response to water stress at different stages of plant growth. Particularly in the light of climate change with rising population numbers and increasing water scarcity, an optimal solution for this task is of paramount importance. We solve the corresponding complex multidimensional and nonlinear optimization problem, i.e., finding the ideal schedule for maximum crop yield with a given water volume by a well tailored approach which offers straightforward application facilities. A global optimization technique allows, together with physically based modeling, for the risk assessment in yield reduction considering different sources of uncertainty (e.g., climate, soil conditions, and management). A new stochastic framework for decision support is developed which aims at optimal climate change adaption strategies in irrigation. It consists of: (1) a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate change; (2) a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply; and (3) mechanistic models for rigorously simulating water transport and crop growth. The result, namely, stochastic crop-water production functions, allows to assess the impact of climate variability on potential yield and thus provides a valuable tool for estimating minimum water demands for irrigation in water resources planning and management, assisting furthermore in generating maps of yield uncertainty for specific crops and specific agricultural areas. The tool is successfully applied at an experimental site in southern France. The impacts of predicted climate variability on maize are discussed.},
