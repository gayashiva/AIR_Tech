\begin{abstract}

  Artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs), also called ice stupas, are a climate-change adaptation strategy developed
  in the Indian Himalayas (Ladakh). With this technology, otherwise unused stream/spring water is stored in
  large ice towers during the winter. The surplus melt water generated in spring is used to satisfy irrigation
  water demands. Recent studies have shown that, during AIR construction, over 75\% of the water sprayed is
  lost. In order to reduce these water losses, different fountain scheduling strategies implemented on two AIRs
  under identical weather conditions were compared. In one scheduling strategy, the fountain was operated
  manually (unscheduled fountain) whereas in another it was operated via an automation system (scheduled
  fountain). The automation system computed recommended discharge rates using real-time meterological input and
  location metadata. Scheduled fountains produced similar ice volume while consuming one-tenth of the water the
  unscheduled fountain used. Simulations converting unscheduled fountains into scheduled fountains showed a
  threefold improvement in water-use efficiency. Overall, these results show that automated fountain water
  supply management can increase water-use efficiency of AIRs and reduce their maintenance without compromising
  their meltwater production.

\introduction

Climate warming has resulted in retreat and thinning of mountain glaciers
\citep{ipccCrossChapterPaperMountains2022}. This has implications for water availability in river basins that
have considerable glacierized areas in their headwaters, such as High Mountain Asia (HMA). Glaciers in HMA
provide an important gradual release of water that is used by many people locally and downstream for irrigation,
drinking water and hydropower. Climate change in this densely populated region may have serious consequences for
glacier melt water supply to the rivers \citep{immerzeelImportanceVulnerabilityWorld2020}. In this context, the
development of water storage technologies is crucial to ensure continued sustenance of cryosphere-fed irrigation
networks.

These issues are particularly pronounced in arid and semiarid regions, where it is estimated that between 50 \%
and 90 \% of freshwater resources originate from mountain catchments
\citep{mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015}. Especially in the cold-arid Trans-Himalayan region of
Ladakh, meltwater supply from the cryosphere is of utmost importance for irrigated agriculture in spring and
summer, when water demand is highest \citep{nusserCryosphereFedIrrigationNetworks2019}. Due to the short growing
period, central Ladakh is a single-cropping area with barley and wheat as important staples, complemented by
vegetables, pulses, and oil seeds \citep{nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}. Depending on the altitude,
irrigation with complete flooding of fields starts between March and April prior to the melting of high-altitude
glaciers. This results in increased demand during a period of reduced supply at the onset of the agricultural
season.

To cope with this recurrent water scarcity, villagers have developed artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs; Fig.
\ref{fig:AIRforms}a). AIRs capture water during autumn and winter, freezing and holding it until spring, when
this water melts and flows down to irrigate the fields \citep{ipccChapterHighMountain2019, vinceGlacierMan2009,
clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017, nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019}; thus retaining a previously
unused portion of the annual flow and facilitating its use to compensate the decreased flow during the following
spring. Over the past decade, several AIRs have been built to supplement the irrigation water supply of mountain
villages in India \citep{wangchukIceStupaCompetition2020, palmerStoringFrozenWater2022,
aggarwalAdaptationClimateChange2021}, Pakistan \citep{awazproductionIceStupaArtificial2022}, Kyrgyzstan
\citep{bbcnewsBrightArtificialGlacier2020}, Nepal, and Chile \citep{reutersConservationistsChileAim2021}. In
total, more than 500 farmers have constructed AIRs across 30 villages in the Alps, Andes and Hindu Kush
Himalayas.

A spirit of improvisation guides the construction strategy of AIRs, challenging their classification.
Construction strategies using fountain systems form AIRs which tend towards a conical shape, whereas other
strategies form flat sheets of ice. Therefore, in the present study, the AIRs are classified based on whether or
not fountain systems are used for their construction. AIRs using fountain systems are called ice stupas (Fig.
\ref{fig:AIRforms}c) and those without are called ice terraces (Fig. \ref{fig:AIRforms}b). In the present work,
the ice stupa form of AIRs are investigated.

\end{figure}

A common issue of AIR construction systems is fountain scheduling, namely answering the questions “when to
spray?,” “how much?,” and “for how long?.” Starting a fountain spray too early, spraying too much water, or
running a fountain spray for too long might lead to overwatering; at the very least, this practice wastes water.
Similarly, starting the fountain spray too late, spraying too little water, or not running the system for long
enough might lead to underwatering and can cause reduced ice volume or freeze the water supply pipelines.
Previous work \citep{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022} has shown that manual construction
systems suffer from overwatering. To avoid this issue, the energy balance model developed in
\cite{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022} can be used to regulate fountain water supply
through its surface freezing rate estimations. However, the model needs to be initialised with an accurate
estimation of fountain spray radius to produce these freezing rates. In theory, this can be estimated by
modelling the projectile motion of water droplets using fountain characteristics such as aperture diameter and
discharge rate. In practice, this estimation depends also on the relative importance of wind-driven
redistribution effects. Therefore, estimating fountain spray radius requires a better understanding of the
relative contribution of these two processes. 

Other practical issues need to be addressed before dealing with fountain scheduling processes: for example, in
Indian AIRs, the fountain discharge rate could theoretically be halved since this is always twice as high as the
modelled freezing rate \citep{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022}. However, in practice, a
reduction of the discharge rate could increase the maintenance cost due to a higher risk of freezing events in
the fountain pipeline. Therefore, one should first prevent the occurrence of freezing events in the fountain
pipeline. These events can be prevented by setting a minimum threshold for the recommended discharge rate.
Additionally, discharge rates recommended need to be sensitive to constraints on water supply or weather
conditions at the construction site; for example, locations limited by their water supply such as Ladakh, India
would prioritize water-use efficiency, whereas those limited by the duration of their favorable weather windows
such as Guttannen, Switzerland would prioritize maximum ice volume. Accordingly, two types of model parameter
optimization are used that prevent underwatering and overwatering to attain higher ice volume and higher
water-use efficiency, respectively. 

Adjusting fountain discharge rates in response to significant diurnal and seasonal variations of freezing rates
necessicates the use of automation systems. Therefore, this paper describes such an automated construction strategy
that can reduce water losses and maintenance requirements compared to manual construction strategies. First, two
AIRs were built in the same location with and without automated fountain scheduling strategies; both were
measured and compared. In a second step, differences in construction strategies between Indian and Swiss AIRs
studied in previous winters were quantified using model simulations. 

% Adjusting fountain discharge rates manually is not practical since this would involve constant adjustments of
% discharge rates in response to significant diurnal and seasonal variations of freezing rates. Therefore, the
% operation of scheduled fountains via automation systems is preferred to reduce long-term maintenance costs. 


\section{Site locations and data collection}

In the present work, data sets from \citet{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022} are used along
with new data sets. These old data sets record the meteorological conditions and fountain characteristics of
AIRs built in Gangles, India (IN21) and Guttannen, Switzerland (CH21) during the winter of 2020--21. The new AIR
data sets were collected in Guttannen, Switzerland during the winter of 2021--22 (CH22).

The Guttannen site (46.66 $\degree$N, 8.29 $\degree$E) is situated in the Berne region, Switzerland at an
altitude of 1047 $m$ a.s.l. During the winter (Oct-Apr), mean daily minimum and maximum air temperatures vary
between $-$13 and 15 $\degree C$. Clear skies are rare, averaging around 7 days during winter. Daily winter
precipitation can sometimes be as high as 100 $mm$. These values are based on 30 years of hourly historical
weather data measurements \citep{meteoblueClimateGuttannen2021}. Two AIRs were constructed by the Guttannen
Bewegt Association, the University of Fribourg, and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts during
the winter of 2021--22 using a manual and an automated construction strategy.

\begin{figure}[htb]

  Guttannen. Photo: Daniel Bürki}
\label{fig:2AIR}
\end{figure}

The automated and manual AIRs were constructed adjacent to each other with different fountain
designs, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:2AIR}. This ensures both AIRs share water source and identical
weather conditions. In addition, a webcam guaranteed continuous surveillance of the automated AIR.   

In the AIR constructed with the manual strategy, tree branches were laid covering the fountain pipe to
initiate and accelerate the ice cone formation process. In the AIR constructed with an automated strategy, only
the fountain pipe was placed before the water spray started. Construction of both AIRs began on December 8, 2021
(start date) on a 13-cm-thick snow bed and ended on April 12, 2022 (expiry date).

In the manual AIR, the fountain was always operated at maximum possible discharge rate, whereas in the automated
AIR, the fountain discharge rate was controlled using real-time weather input and several control parameters
which could be modified via a user interface. Henceforth, the fountain used in the manual AIR is referred as
unscheduled fountain and the fountain used in the automated AIR is referred as scheduled fountain.

\subsection{Meteorological data}

To calculate the surface energy balance of an AIR, the following variables are required: air temperature,
relative humidity, wind speed, pressure, precipitation, incoming longwave radiation, shortwave radiation, and
cloudiness index. The primary weather data source is an automatic weather station (AWS) located within 20 $m$
from the AIRs. Hourly ground temperature measurements ata depth of 30 $cm$ were also recorded by the AWS to
obtain approximate values of the fountain water temperature. Less than 0.4 \% of data was missing, and data gaps
were filled by linear interpolation. However, two additional datasets were used to obtain all the necessary
input variables, namely cloudiness index and precipitation. These two datasets were obtained from ERA5
reanalysis dataset \citep{hersbachERA5GlobalReanalysis2020} and a MeteoSwiss AWS located 184 $m$ from the AIRs
(Station ID: 0-0756-0-GTT).

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/disvstemp.png}
\caption{Temperature and discharge measurements of the two fountains at the Guttannen construction site.}
\label{fig:aws} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fountain observations}

The scheduled and unscheduled fountains present the following attributes: discharge rate ($Q$), height ($h$), water
temperature ($T_F$), nozzle pressure loss ($P_{nozzle}$), and the spray radius ($r$). Discharge rate represents
the discharge rate of water in the fountain pipeline. Height denotes the height of the fountain pipeline
installed. Fountain water temperature is the temperature of water droplets produced by the fountain. The nozzle
pressure loss denotes the pressure consumed during the formation of water droplets. Spray radius denotes the
observed ice radius formed from the fountain water droplets.

Height was increased in steps of 1 $m$ for both fountains. For the scheduled fountain, the
initial height was 3 $m$ and was increased to 4 $m$ on December 23. For the unscheduled
fountain, the initial height was 3.7 $m$ and was increased twice---December
23 and February 12.

Figure \ref{fig:aws} shows the temporal variation in temperature and discharge rate for both the scheduled and
unscheduled fountains. The unscheduled fountain showed variations in discharge rate whenever the fountain height
was increased. The discharge rate variations of the scheduled fountain were caused by the control valve of the
automation system. The control ball valve position between 0 and 100 \% (or 0 to 90 $\degree$) was regulated
based on real-time meteorological conditions. Throughout the study period, the control valve was opened
completely (100 \%) only once, corresponding to the moment in time when temperature attained its minimum of $-$13
$\degree \, C$ on December 20. The control valve was never opened beyond 34 \% thereafter.  

The unscheduled fountain was manually operated to spray all the available discharge until a fountain freezing
event interrupted the discharge on February 17. Unfortunately, no discharge rate measurements were recorded
for the unscheduled fountain. However, the unscheduled fountain presented a higher discharge rate
compared with the scheduled fountain due to its higher aperture area (Fig. \ref{fig:2AIR}). Therefore, we
conservatively assume the discharge rate of the unscheduled fountain to be equal to the maximum discharge rate
of the scheduled fountain, which was observed to be 13 $l/min$ and 11 $l/min$ at a fountain height of 3 $m$ and 4
$m$, respectively.

\subsection{Drone surveys}

Several photogrammetric surveys were conducted on the manual and the automated AIRs. The digital elevation
models (DEMs) generated from the obtained imagery were analysed to document ice radius, surface area, and
volume of the ice structures. Ice radius measurements from drone flights showed either an increase in
AIR circumference or volume and were averaged to determine the fountain spray radius. The number of drone surveys
conducted for the manual and the automated AIRs was 8 and 6, respectively (Table \ref{tab:uav}). We
attach a high uncertainty of $\pm 10 \%$ for all AIR observations to accommodate for the uncertainties in
the geodetic processing methodology described in the supplementary materials of \citet{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022}.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Fountain scheduling software}

Recommended discharge rates can be produced only when information about AIR surface properties and weather
conditions is available. In particular, resolving the uncertainty in the expected freezing rate requires
quantification of slope, albedo, and cloudiness. However, these properties cannot be predicted, and therefore,
the upper and lower bound of each variable is associated with a different model depending on whether these
increase the freezing rate or not. Higher albedo and slope values decrease the shortwave radiation impact.
Higher cloudiness values increase both the shortwave and the longwave radiation impact. The model overestimating
the freezing rate is hereinafter referred as ice volume optimized model (IVOM) and the model underestimating the
freezing rate, water-use efficiency optimized model (WEOM). Accordingly, the values assigned for all three
variables in each model are presented in Table \ref{tab:assumptions}.

The discharge scheduling software implements two types of fountain scheduling strategies depending on which
model type is suitable. The WEOM model type is used when the location presents limited water quantity, as this
is expected to produce better water-use efficiency. The IVOM model type is used when the location presents
limited duration of favorable weather windows, as this is expected to produce higher ice volume. These two types
of scheduled fountains are hereafter referred as water-sensitive fountain and weather-sensitive fountain,
respectively.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{Assumptions for the parametrization introduced to simplify the ice volume optimized model (IVOM) and the
water-use efficiency optimized model (WEOM). $\alpha_{snow/ice}$ represents albedo of snow or ice.}
\label{tab:assumptions}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Estimation of} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{IVOM} & \textbf{WEOM} & \\ \midrule

\multicolumn{1}{|l}{Cloudiness}  & $cld$ & $0$ & $1$ & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The assumptions described in Table \ref{tab:assumptions} are applied on the one-dimensional description of
energy fluxes as used in \cite{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022} to obtain the rate of
change of AIR ice mass as follows: 

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta M_{ice}}{\Delta t}  =  (\frac{q_{SW} + q_{LW} + q_{S} + q_{F} + q_{R} + q_{G} - q_{T}}{L_F} + \frac{q_{L}}{L_V} ) \cdot A_{cone}
	\label{eqn:auto}
\end{equation}

Upward and downward fluxes relative to the ice surface are positive and negative, respectively. The first term
represents the mass change rate due to freezing of the fountain water and melting of the ice. $q_{SW}$ is the
net shortwave radiation; $q_{LW}$ is the net longwave radiation; $q_{L}$ and $q_{S}$ are the turbulent latent
and sensible heat fluxes, respectively; $q_{F}$ is the fountain discharge heat flux; $q_{R}$ is the rain water
heat flux; $q_{G}$ is the bulk heat flux between the AIR surface and its interior; $q_{T}$ is the temperature
heat flux, and $A_{cone}$ is the area of the AIR surface. $L_F$ and $L_{V}$ represent latent heat of fusion and
vaporization, respectively. The derivation of these individual terms for the IVOM and WEOM model versions are
discussed in Appendix \ref{sec:SEB}.

Equation \ref{eqn:auto} is implemented in the automation software. The user interface of the software enables
input of the spray radius, altitude, latitude, and longitude of the construction location. The automation
hardware consists of an AWS, flowmeter, control valve, drain valves, air valves, fountain, pipeline, and a
logger. The logger feeds the AWS data to the automation software and informs of the recommended discharge rate
to the flowmeter. The flowmeter adjusts the control valve to match the recommendation. In case a termination
criterion gets met, the drain and air valves allow removal of water and entry of air in the pipeline,
respectively.

The recommended discharge rate is equal to the mass change rate. However, certain termination criteria listed
below override the discharge rate recommendation and drain the pipeline to prevent water loss or fountain
freezing events:

\begin{itemize}

\item High water loss is assumed when wind speed is greater than user-defined critical wind speed.

\item High risk of fountain freezing is assumed when mass change rate is lower than user-defined minimum fountain discharge rate. 

\item Freezing events in fountain pipeline are assumed when measured discharge rate equals zero for at least 20
  seconds. 

\item Pipeline leakage is assumed when measured discharge rate is greater than user-defined maximum fountain discharge rate.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modelling fountain spray radius} \label{sec:r_F}

Fountain spray radius is defined as the largest horizontal distance covered by fountain water droplets. This can
be determined by modelling the trajectory of these droplets using the projectile motion equation. This
projectile motion starts at the fountain nozzle and ends at the AIR surface.  To obtain the droplets speed
($v$), the measured aperture diameter ($dia = 0.001 m$) is used and discharge rate of the scheduled fountain
with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:dis}
v = \frac{4 \cdot Q}{60 \cdot 1000 \cdot \pi \cdot dia^2}
\end{equation}

where $v$ is the droplet speed in $m/s$ and $Q$ is the discharge rate of the fountain in $l/min$.

To obtain the spray radius ($r$), the optimum launch angle $\theta = 45 \degree$ is used in the projectile motion
equation to get:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:radf}
  r = \frac{v \cdot(v + \sqrt{v^2 + 4hg)}}{2g}
\end{equation}

The influence of wind-driven redistribution can be included in the spray radius by multiplying wind speed
by time of flight of water droplets.

\subsection{Determination of pressure losses} \label{sec:p_loss}

The fountain pipeline system delivering water to the ice stupa suffers several pressure losses, which limit the
maximum height that the fountain can achieve. These lossses can be (a) altitudinal ($P_{alt}$), (b) frictional
($P_{friction}$), and (c) nozzle ($P_{nozzle}$) losses. The altitudinal losses depend on the altitude difference
between the source and the fountain. The frictional losses are proportional to the length of the pipeline and
inversely proportional to their diameter. The nozzle losses depend on the engineering design of the fountain
nozzle.

Pressure losses can be determined using the Bernoulli equation as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:pressure}
  P_{source} = P_{alt} + P_{friction} + P_{nozzle} + \frac{\rho \cdot v^2}{2} \cdot 10 ^{-5}
\end{equation}

where $P_{source}$ is the source pressure, $P_{nozzle}$ is the pressure loss due to the fountain nozzle, and
$P_{alt}$ is the pressure loss due to the altitudinal difference between the pipeline input and fountain output.
These pressure variables are measured in bars.  The speed $v$ can be determined from discharge rate observations
using Eq. \ref{eqn:dis}. 

The frictional loss of the pipeline used in the experiment can be determined using the 
Hagen–Poiseuille equation \citep{batchelor2000introduction}:  

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:friction}
  P_{friction} = \frac{3.2 \cdot \mu \cdot v \cdot L}{\rho \cdot g \cdot dia^2}
\end{equation}

where $P_{friction}$ is in bars, $L$ is the total length of the pipeline measured in meters, and $v$ is the water speed in
$m/s$. Note that the above equation only applies for laminar flow, the one investigated in the present work.


\subsection{Model updates}

The present study focuses on the integration of fountain scheduling processes with the AIR model
\citep{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022}. For details on model internals and calculation of
surface processes, please refer to the respective literature references. 

In the previous version of the model \citep{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022}, fountain
water temperature ($T_F$) was estimated as a constant parameter. However, in reality, this is a poor
approximation because it does not account for two processes, namely temperature fluctuations during transit from
the source to the fountain nozzle or temperature fluctuations during the flight time of water droplets after
leaving the fountain nozzle. Therefore, the first process is approximated with hourly ground temperature values
measured 30 $cm$ below the ground. To approximate the second process, the water temperature is assumed to cool
down to 0 $\degree\,C$ during subzero air temperature conditions.

In the previous version of the model \citep{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022}, fountain
discharge events were reset from surface albedo to ice albedo. However, this assumption limits the accuracy of
the model, especially for the automated AIR, where several fountain discharge events of short duration occur.
Therefore, the discharge events are assumed to reduce the albedo decay rate ($\tau$) by a factor of
$\frac{\alpha_{ice}}{\alpha_{snow}}$.

Additionally, both AIRs experienced numerous precipitation events. Therefore, instead of assuming AIR density
($\rho_{cone}$) to be equal to ice density---which was no longer accurate---the density
parametrization was changed as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \rho_{cone} = \frac{M_{F} + M_{dep} + M_{ppt}}{(M_{F} + M_{dep})/\rho_{ice} + M_{ppt}/\rho_{snow}}
\end{equation}

where $M_F$ is the cumulative mass of the fountain discharge, $M_{ppt}$ is the cumulative precipitation,
$M_{dep}$ is the cumulative accumulation through water vapour deposition, $\rho_{ice}$ is the ice density (917
$kg\,m^{-3}$), and $\rho_{snow}$ is the density of wet snow (300 $kg\,m^{-3}$) taken from
\cite{cuffeyPhysicsGlaciers2010}.

Rain events were not considered in the previous version of the model, but these occurred in this experiment. The
influence of rain events on the albedo and the energy balance was assumed to be similar to the discharge events.
However, the water temperature of a rain event was assumed to be equal to the air temperature; accordingly, the
rain water heat flux ($q_{R}$) generated due to a rain event was equal to:

\begin{equation}
  q_{R} = \frac{\Delta M_{ppt} \cdot c_{water} \cdot T_{a}}{\Delta t \cdot A_{cone}}
\end{equation}

where $M_{ppt}$ is the hourly precipitation in meters, $c_{water}$ is the specific heat of water, and $A_{cone}$
is the surface area.

\subsection{Calibration}

The model parameters were calibrated to the mean values of the ranges presented in Appendix Table
\ref{tab:parameters}. However, the surface layer thickness parameter was calibrated to a value of 0.09 $m$ for
the automated AIR instead of the default value of 0.05 $m$. This calibration was necessary to prevent hourly
surface temperature fluctuations from assuming unphysical values above 40 $\degree\,C$.

The validation of the model for the manual and automated AIRs were evaluated using the root mean squared
error (RMSE) between volume estimates and measurements. 

Performance of the IVOM and WEOM versions of the physical model were assessed by comparing the correlation of its
discharge rate estimates with the validated freezing rates of the manual AIR.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Model validation}

The volume estimation for the automated and manual AIRs showed an RMSE of 8 $m^3$ and 6 $m^3$, respectively, with the drone
volume observations. These are within 13 \% and 11 \% of the maximum volume of the automated and
the manual AIR, respectively. The estimated and measured AIR volumes are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:validation}.

\subsection{Comparison of AIR construction strategies}

Table \ref{tab:mb} presents the influence of the two different fountain scheduling strategies in the mass and energy balance
of their respective AIRs.  The overall impact of the radiation fluxes---longwave and shortwave---and the
turbulent fluxes---sensible and latent---on the freezing and melting energies is determined by their 
energy turnover, which is calculated as the sum of energy fluxes in absolute values (Table
\ref{tab:mb}). 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/dis_processes.png}
\caption{(a) Surface albedo  and (b) fountain discharge heat flux showed significant variations between the two
  AIRs due to differences in their discharge rates.}
\label{fig:dis_processes}
\end{figure}

Fountain scheduling reduced the fountain discharge input and fountain wastewater output by an order of
magnitude. However, this does not result in an appreciable difference in the volume evolution of the automated
or manual AIR, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:validation}. This is due to two counteracting surface processes
during fountain spray: process A consists in the dampening of albedo to ice albedo and process B consists in the absorption of heat energy from the
fountain water droplets. The temporal variation of the magnitude of these processes is shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:dis_processes}.

A considerable difference exists in the contribution of the shortwave radiation due to process A. Although the unscheduled fountain was active for a longer duration, frequent snowfall events
counteracted the albedo feedback of the fountain discharge. In contrast, the albedo of the automated AIR was
reduced by late fountain spray events, in particular in March and April, as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:dis_processes}. These poorly timed fountain spray events occurred because of the global solar radiation
diurnal variation, since these were calibrated based on values for February in the automation system.
Therefore, poor calibration of the automation system resulted in an increased impact of shortwave radiation on
the automated AIR. Similarly, the fountain discharge heat flux for the manual AIR was enhanced due to
process B. The higher discharge value of the unscheduled fountain and its longer duration are responsible
for the higher contribution of fountain discharge heat flux in the overall energy turnover. Therefore, higher
melt of the automated AIR due to process A counteracted the higher melt of the manual AIR due to process B.

\subsection{Benefits of scheduling fountains}

The difference in water-use efficiency and maximum ice volume between unscheduled and scheduled fountains in the Indian and Swiss
locations across two winters is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:wue}a. Four experimental values (highlighted in
circles) and five simulated values (highlighted in squares) are shown together.  The experimental values were
taken from the IN21 and CH21 AIRs studied in \citet{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022} and
the CH22 AIR investigated in the present work. 

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/wue.png}

\caption{(a) The maximum volume and water-use efficiency estimated for AIRs constructed in different locations
(represented by symbols) with different fountain scheduling strategies (represented by colours). Experimental
values are highlighted in circles and simulated values are highlighted in squares. (b) Comparison of
the unscheduled and scheduled fountain discharge rates at the IN21 location.}

\label{fig:wue}
\end{figure*}

The water-use efficiency of all the unscheduled fountains is below 20 \%. In general, water-use efficiency
exhibits a threefold increase when the weather- or water-sensitive fountains are used in both
locations.  

For the Indian location, the three different kinds of fountains yielded significantly different results owing to
discharge duration and maximum discharge rate (Fig. \ref{fig:wue}b). The unscheduled fountain showed a maximum
discharge rate more than twice that of the scheduled fountains, resulting in higher water loss; freezing events
in its pipeline caused frequent interruptions in the unscheduled discharge rate (Fig. \ref{fig:wue}b). In
contrast, the mean freezing rates of the other two fountains during these events were above their median values.
This is because very cold temperatures freeze the water inside rather than outside the fountain system,
instigating these freezing events in the fountain pipeline. Therefore, the discharge duration of the unscheduled
fountain was much lower, resulting in lower ice volume. The water-sensitive fountain underestimated the freezing
rate during the construction period and therefore produced much lower ice volume compared with the
weather-sensitive fountain. 

For the Swiss locations, scheduled fountains yielded better water-use efficiency but did not significantly alter the maximum
volume obtained. 

\subsection{Performance of weather- and water-sensitive fountains}

The WEOM and IVOM model versions estimated the freezing rate of the unscheduled fountain with an RMSE less than
0.8 $l/min$ and 1.8 $l/min$, respectively, and a correlation of 0.4. The discharge rate values of the
weather-sensitive fountain overestimated the freezing rate 93 \% of the fountain spray duration, whereas those
of the water-sensitive fountain overestimated the freezing rate 70 \% of the unscheduled fountain spray
duration, as illustrated by Fig. \ref{fig:simvsreal}. Therefore, the IVOM model version was successful in
prioritizing the maximum ice volume by overestimating the discharge rates, but the WEOM model version could not
sufficiently underestimate its discharge rate values to optimize water-use efficiency.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Figures/simvsreal.jpg}

\caption{ Comparison of the freezing rate estimated for the unscheduled fountain and the discharge rate of the
scheduled fountains. }

\label{fig:simvsreal}
\end{figure*}

However, for the Indian location, significant magnitude differences can be observed among the three kinds of
fountains. The modelled weather- and water-sensitive discharge rate values were a factor of two and three smaller, respectively,
than the measured unscheduled discharge rate (Fig. \ref{fig:wue}b).

\subsection{Pressure losses}

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{Pipeline configuration of the automated ice stupa.}
\label{tab:pipe}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}

\multicolumn{1}{|l}{Water viscosity}  & $\mu$ & 0.00152 $Pa\,s$ & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Pressure consumption across the fountain pipeline provides insights into how it can be better optimized. The
pipeline configuration of the automated ice stupa fountain is presented in Table \ref{tab:pipe}. Pressure drops
due to frictional losses across the length of the pipeline and due to the design of the fountain nozzle. Maximum
frictional loss occurs during maximum discharge, which was measured to be 11 $l/min$. By substituting the
corresponding values in Eq. \ref{eqn:friction}, we get $P_{friction}$ to be 0.3 $bar$. The speed $v$ can be
determined from the discharge rate observation using Eq. \ref{eqn:radf}. Therefore, from Eq. \ref{eqn:pressure},
$P_{nozzle}$ was estimated to be 4.6 $bar$, which represents more than 75 \% of the source water pressure. Most
of the input pressure was used by the fountain nozzle to generate water droplets.


\subsection{Influence of wind-driven redistribution on fountain spray radius}

The estimated volume changes during the month of January of the Swiss AIRs built in the winter of 2021--22 is less
than half that of the AIRs from the previous winter (CH21). This difference cannot respond to warmer
temperatures during the CH22 winter, as the median January temperature of CH22 winter was colder than that of the
CH21 winter (Fig. \ref{fig:CH_diffs}a). Moreover, the volume growth of CH20 AIR is 6 times that of the CH22 AIR,
despite CH20 winter being 3 $\degree C$ warmer.

We suspect the primary driver of volume difference across different winters to be the spray radius (Fig.
\ref{fig:CH_diffs}b). However, this observation contradicts our expectation that AIRs using the same water
source and fountain designs would present similar spray radius. Moreover, manual measurements of the fountain
spray radius were lower than the drone observations of the ice radius. These two observations imply that wind
drift of water droplets could play a major role in temporal fluctuations of ice radius.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/CH_diffs.jpg}

\caption{(a) Estimated volume change and temperature. (b) Observed spray radius and wind speed
during January for AIRs built across three winters. } 

\label{fig:CH_diffs} 
\end{figure*}

To validate this hypothesis, the projectile motion of scheduled fountain water droplets were modelled with wind
speed values taken from CH22 and CH21 experiments. Figure \ref{fig:wind} shows the modelled spray radius
produced using these two wind datasets and compares them with the measured spray radius values. As illustrated,
wind speed drives the temporal variation in the spray radius. Moreover, the spray radius of the scheduled
fountain is much higher with CH22 wind values than with those of CH21. Therefore, the determination of the
fountain spray radius cannot be performed using the characteristics of the fountain nozzle alone, as this is
significantly influenced by the temporal variation of the wind speed.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Recommendations and challenges to improve AIR hardware tools}

The present study shows shows one strategy that can improve the water-use efficiency of AIRs. We chose this
strategy because it enables the use of the AIR model in a simple and effective manner. However, all these
construction strategies are limited by the tools they use, namely the fountain, the pipeline and the automation
system. Below we discuss why this was the case and provide some recommended methodologies to improve them:

% \subsubsection{Additional water losses}
%
% A portion of the water volume exiting the fountains does not reach the ground due to both
% thermodynamic---evaporation and sublimation---and mechanical---wind-driven redistribution---effects. Although
% these water losses can be significant \citep{hanzerSimulationSnowManagement2020}, their simulation with physical
% formulation is challenging because this is sensitive to the diameter of the water droplets produced by the
% fountain.

\subsubsection{Fountain optimisation}

Contrary to the model assumptions, the parameters used to define the fountain were not independent. The fountain
height, fountain aperture diameter (both ignored in this analysis), discharge rate, water temperature and spray
radius were related through the trajectories of the water droplets.

The fountain nozzle design is crucial for increasing the ice volume obtained. It determines the diameter of the
water droplets and the angle of launch for their projectile motion. The choice of these two parameters
determines the rate of nuclueation process, pressure losses and discharge rate ranges. For example, during the
IN21 experiment, snow formation was observed, indicating that the fountain water droplets have the potential to
freeze before deposition on the AIR surface. In the CH22 experiment, the higher aperture diameter of the
unscheduled fountain nozzle (Fig. \ref{fig:2AIR}) produced bigger droplets and, therefore, had a lower fountain
pressure loss when compared to the scheduled fountain. However, fountains with high aperture diameter do not
form water droplets at low discharge rates. Therefore, the scheduled fountain nozzle design was used since it
was able to produce water droplets with discharge rates as low as 2 $l/min$.

However, no methodology currently exists to rank the several fountain nozzles used for construction. Quantifying
processes influenced by the fountain nozzle is challenging as it would require modelling the conduction,
convection, wind redistribution, and nucleation processes that all droplets undergo during their flight time.
Instead, controlled experiments comparing the freezing rates between different fountain diameters have a better
chance to yield insights on the engineering design of fountain nozzles.

\subsubsection{Pipeline optimisation}

An ideal pipeline configuration could make this technology cheaper and maintenance free. However, optimization
of the pipeline material and diameters is yet to be performed---despite the time lost on pipeline freezing
events and the potential cost reduction with cheaper pipeline materials and sizes. Larger pipeline diameters
reduce the occurence of pipeline freezing events but increase the cost dramatically. In Ladakh, pipeline
diameters used have a wide range (from 1 to 10 $inches$) since the choice of pipeline diameter also depends on
the additional insulation provided and whether or not it is buried. Therefore, a comprehensive cost-benefit
analysis of different combinations of insulation and pipeline materials is required to determine the optimum
design of the insulated pipeline system.  

\subsubsection{Cost reduction of automation system}

Our strategy is not yet suitable for application in current AIR construction sites due to the cost of the
automation system (around 10,000 $USD$). However, we believe upto 10 fold cost reduction is possible through
simpler automation systems which control only the duration of fountain spray and not their quantity. 

\subsection{New ways to upscale irrigation water supply}

In this section, two hypothetical ice stupa construction scenarios namely, historical and futuristic are
described. The historical scenario is a depiction of current construction efforts based on oral interviews and
field experience. The futuristic scenario is a depiction of how the automation system developed can transform
current construction efforts. The objective of both the scenarios is to maximize the meltwater available for
irrigation. Both these scenarios are motivated by the construction campaigns conducted in the Gangles valley of
Ladakh during the winter of 2019/20. This is the same valley where the IN21 study site was located enabling us
to extrapolate some of the freezing rates and ice volume estimations from
\citet{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022}. We conservatively assume that the valley had a
total water supply of around $120\,l/min$, a winter duration of 4 months and the fountain was operational for
only 8 hours per day for both the scenarios. 

\subsubsection{Historical scenario}

In the historical scenario, only two fountains could be operated simultaneously using the available water
supply. This limited the construction period of each ice stupa to just two months. Moreover, pipelines froze
inside with ice blocks every few nights (Fig. \ref{fig:gangles_data}). This resulted in two farmers investing
more than two months removing ice blocks and repairing the fountain pipeline system to make 4 ice stupas.
Assuming each ice stupa had a maximum ice volume similar to IN21, we expect the total ice volumes frozen in this
valley to be around 3 million litres.   

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/gangles_data}

  \caption{(a) The IN21 ice stupa is a good example of the typical construction scenario (Photo: Norboo
  Thinles). (b) Its observed fountain discharge rate (red line) was interrupted several times due to pipeline
freezing events. The discharge quantities used were also much higher than the estimated freezing rate (green
line). }

	\label{fig:gangles_data}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Futuristic scenario}

In the futuristic scenario, the automation system reduces the water consumption of each ice stupa from
$60\,l/min$ to $30\,l/min$. This enabled two farmers to build 8 ice stupas spending less than a week of effort
since there were no pipeline freezing events to deal with. The total ice volumes frozen, however, resulted in
more than 2 times higher irrigation water supply from mid-April to mid-June (Fig. \ref{fig:icestupa_valley}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/icestupa_valley}

  \caption{More than a month of effort from a dozen farmers were required to build five ice stupas across the
  Gangles valley in the winter of 2019/20. This research provides tools that two farmers can leverage to
  guarantee two times more winter water storage and reduce maintenance requirements to just a few days.}

\conclusions

An automated AIR construction strategy was compared with a manual one using data collected in Guttannen,
Switzerland and Gangles, India.

The main purpose of the present study is to quantify the influence of different fountain scheduling strategies
on the water-use efficiency and ice volume of AIRs exposed to identical weather conditions. It was found that
overwatering by unscheduled fountains not only increased the fountain wastewater production but also enhanced
the melting rate of AIRs, mainly due to surface albedo and fountain heat flux feedbacks. Scheduled fountains, in
contrast, consumed only 13 \% of the unscheduled fountain water supply. However, volume evolution of both AIRs
showed no significant variations. 

Two different model forcing strategies were used to recommend two types of scheduled discharge rates: limited
weather windows to favor higher ice volume and water supply to favor water-use efficiency. These model versions
were able to capture more than 44 \% of the freezing rate variations of the manual AIR. Simulations
converting several unscheduled fountains to scheduled ones showed that at least a threefold increase in
water-use efficiency is possible without compromising meltwater production.

The influence of wind-driven redistribution on the spray radius resulted in AIRs 6 times bigger despite 3
$\degree C$ warmer temperatures. This implies that higher wind speed caused the volume differences in the AIRs
constructed at the Swiss location through three consecutive winters.  However, higher wind speed can also cause
water losses if water droplets are distributed beyond the spray radius. Therefore, a critical wind speed needs
to be determined to force wind-driven redistribution to increase spray radius instead of water losses. Future
selection of construction locations and design of automation algorithms need to capitalize on wind-driven
redistribution effects to further increase water-use efficiency.

Fountain nozzles play an important role in the construction process. First, these consume most of the input
water pressure to form water droplets. Second, their engineering design determines the droplet size distribution
and spray radius. Future research, therefore, must be devoted to engineer fountain nozzles able to create water
droplets with a size distribution that consumes less energy and a trajectory that increases the spray radius.

\appendix


\section{Model forcing based on water-use efficiency and maximum ice volume objectives} \label{sec:SEB}

To reduce model complexity and data requirement \citep{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022},
assumptions that optimize ice volume (IVOM) or water-use efficiency (WEOM) were used. The freezing rate and
melting rate were defined as the positive and negative mass change rate, respectively. The assumptions chosen
were based on whether these overestimate or underestimate the freezing rate. IVOM assumptions overestimate
freezing rate, whereas WEOM assumptions underestimate freezing rate. The application of these two kinds of assumptions
on each energy balance component are described below. 

\subsection{Surface area $A_{cone}$ assumptions}

Determination of surface area during the accumulation period is achieved by assuming a constant ice cone
radius equal to the fountain spray radius. The surface area scales the freezing rate of the AIR. Hence, for the
IVOM version, the maximum possible slope was assumed to be 1 for the ice cone. Therefore, area is estimated as:  

\begin{equation} A_{cone} =\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi \cdot r_{F}^2  \end{equation}

Similarly, for the water-use efficiency objective, the area of the conical AIR is approximated to the area of
its circular base. Therefore, area is estimated as:

\begin{equation} A_{cone} =\pi \cdot r_{F}^2  \end{equation}

\subsection{Net shortwave radiation \texorpdfstring{$q_{SW}$}{Lg} assumptions}
\label{sec:SW}

The net shortwave radiation $q_{SW}$ is computed as follows:

\begin{equation} 
q_{SW} = (1- \alpha) \cdot ( SW_{direct} \cdot f_{cone} + SW_{diffuse})
\label{eqn:SW} 
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the albedo value, $SW_{direct}$ is the direct shortwave radiation, $SW_{diffuse}$ is the
diffuse shortwave radiation, and $f_{cone}$ is the solar area fraction.

The data requirement was reduced by estimating the global shortwave radiation and pressure using directly the
location's coordinates and altitude through the solar radiation model described in
\citet{holmgrenPvlibPythonPython2018}. The algorithm used to estimate the clear-sky global radiation is
described in \citet{ineichenBroadbandSimplifiedVersion2008}.  

The diffuse and direct shortwave radiation are determined using the estimated global solar radiation as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  SW_{diffuse} &= cld \cdot SW_{global}\\
  SW_{direct} &= (1-cld) \cdot SW_{global}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $cld$ is the cloudiness factor. $cld$ is assumed to be 1 and 0 for the water-use efficiency and ice volume
objective, respectively.

The variations in the albedo were ignored and it was assumed to be equal to snow albedo and ice albedo for the
ice volume and water-use efficiency objective, respectively.

The solar area fraction $f_{cone}$ of the ice structure exposed to the direct shortwave radiation depends on the
shape considered and is computed as:

\begin{equation}
		f_{cone} =\frac{(0.5 \cdot r_{cone} \cdot h_{cone}) \cdot cos \theta_{sun} +(\pi \cdot
			{(r_{cone})}^2/2) \cdot sin \theta_{sun} }{\pi \cdot r_{cone} \cdot ({(r_{cone})}^2+{(h_{cone})}^2)^{1/2}}\\
\end{equation}

For the ice volume objective, the slope of the cone was assumed to be 1; $f_{cone}$ is determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
		f_{cone} =\frac{ cos \theta_{sun} + \pi \cdot sin \theta_{sun} }{2\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi }
\end{equation}

Similarly, for the water-use efficiency objective, the slope of the cone was assumed to be negligible.

\begin{equation}
		f_{cone} =\frac{ sin \theta_{sun} }{2 }
\end{equation}

\subsection{Net longwave radiation \texorpdfstring{$q_{LW}$}{Lg} assumptions} 

To determine outgoing longwave radiation, $T_{ice} = 0 \degree C$ was assumed. To constrain the minimum ice
temperature is challenging; therefore, this assumption was maintained for both our objectives. However, to
estimate atmospheric emissivity, $cld$ was assumed to be 1 and 0 for the water-use efficiency and ice volume
objective, respectively.

\subsection{Turbulent fluxes assumptions} \label{sec:Qs}

Turbulent fluxes estimation depends on the slope of the cone through the $\mu_{cone}$ parameter. As suggested 
by \citet{oerlemansBriefCommunicationGrowth2021}, this parameter was estimated as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \mu_{cone} =1 + s_{cone}/2
\end{equation}

Hence, the $\mu_{cone}$ parameter takes values of 1.5 and 1 for the ice volume and water-use efficiency
objective, respectively.  Since turbulent fluxes impact both the freezing and the melting rates, this assumption
may not favor the corresponding objectives for certain sites.
