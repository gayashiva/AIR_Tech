\begin{abstract}
  To sustain productive artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs) with limited water resources requires a high water use
  efficiency (WUE). This can be achieved by the precise scheduling of deficit AIR construction systems taking
  into account the AIRs response to weather and fountain variations. Particularly in the light of climate change
  with rising dependence on this water storage technology, an optimal solution for this task is of paramount
  importance. We solve the corresponding optimization problem, i.e. finding the ideal discharge rate for maximum
  WUE by an approach which offers straightforward application facilities. The automation software uses a
  simplified equation with 6 coefficients that capture the influence of temperature, humidity, wind and solar
  radiation variations on the freezing rate. Historical meteorological data in conjunction with the coordinates,
  altitude and time zone of the site are required to calculate these 6 coefficients. The automated AIR had a WUE
  three times more than the manual AIR. This is a promising result for dry mountain regions, where automated AIR
  technology could scale current mitigation efforts.

\section{Introduction}
Climate change adaptation strategies imperatively require a more efficient and sustainable exploitation of water
resources. In arid climates, agriculture depends almost entirely on irrigation and, as glacier meltwater
dwindles, political and economic pressures are being exerted on farmers to increase irrigation efficiency. Thus,
a high water use efficiency (WUE) is the prerequisite for a sustainable agricultural production with limited
water resources. 

Automated weather and fountain based scheduling methods are one option for reducing watering volumes for AIR
construction systems and, at the same time, increase WUE.

Proper scheduling requires answers to two questions: When should the water be turned on and off? How much water
should be sprayed?

\section{Study Sites and data}

\section{Automation software}
\subsection{Model simplification}

The objective of the automation software is to estimate the optimal discharge rate given minimal weather,
fountain and location information. In order to do so, we simplify the methodology used in our previous paper
with some assumptions. We tend to use assumptions that overestimate the associated freezing rate to optimise
more for maximum ice volume rather than WUE. Below we present each of our assumptions corresponding to the
different model modules in our previous paper.

\subsection{Surface area calculation} \label{sec:shape}

The software approximates the area of the conical AIR to be equal to the area of its circular base. Therefore,
the surface area used

\begin{equation} A_{cone} =\pi \cdot r_{cone}^2 \label{eq:Area} \end{equation}

Admittedly, this assumption underestimates the surface area of the AIR during the accumulation period and
overestimates the surface area during the ablation period.  

\subsection{Energy balance calculation} \label{sec:energy}

We approximate the energy balance at the surface of an AIR by a one-dimensional description of energy fluxes as
used in \cite{Balasubramanian_2022}:

\begin{equation}
	 q_{freeze} + q_{melt} = q_{SW} + q_{LW} + q_{L} + q_{S}
	\label{eqn:EB}
\end{equation}

Upward and downward fluxes relative to the ice surface are positive and negative, respectively. The first two
terms represent the energy change used for freezing the fountain water and melting the ice respectively. The
third term represents the energy used for changing the surface temperature. $q_{SW}$ is the net shortwave
radiation; $q_{LW}$ is the net longwave radiation; $q_{L}$ and $q_{S}$ are the turbulent latent and sensible
heat fluxes.  Here, we define the surface temperature $T_{ice}$ to be the modelled average temperature of the
icestupa surface layer.

The software ignores $q_{T}$, $q_{F}$ and $q_{G}$. All these assumptions overestimate the freezing energy flux.

\subsubsection{Net Shortwave Radiation \texorpdfstring{$q_{SW}$}{Lg}} \label{sec:SW}

The net shortwave radiation $q_{SW}$ is computed as follows:

\begin{equation} q_{SW} = (1- \alpha_{ice})\cdot SW_{global} \label{eqn:SW} \end{equation}

where $\alpha_{ice}$ is the bare ice albedo value (0.25) and $SW_{global}$ is the global shortwave radiation.
The global shortwave radiation used is modelled using the parametrisation proposed by \cite{Woolf_1968}.

The software ignores (a) the differential absorption of $SW_{direct}$ and $SW_{diffuse}$ due to the conical
shape and (b) the variations in the albedo to simplify the model. Both these assumptions overestimate the solar
radiation thereby underestimating the freezing energy flux.

\subsubsection{Net Longwave Radiation \texorpdfstring{$q_{LW}$}{Lg}} \label{sec:LW}

The net longwave radiation $q_{LW}$ is determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	q_{LW}= \sigma \cdot \epsilon_a \cdot {(T_a+ 273.15)}^4 -\sigma \cdot \epsilon_{ice} \cdot {(T_{ice}+ 273.15)}^4
	\label{eqn:LW}
\end{equation}

where $T_a$ represents the measured air temperature, $\epsilon_a$ denotes the atmospheric emissivity $T_{ice}$
is the modelled surface temperature given in [$\degree C$], $\sigma=5.67\cdot10^{-8}\,Jm^{-2}s^{-1}K^{-4}$ is
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $\epsilon_{ice}$ is the corresponding emissivity value for the Icestupa
surface (0.97).

 We approximate the atmospheric emissivity $\epsilon_a$ using the
equation suggested by \cite{Brutsaert_1975}, considering air temperature and vapor pressure (Eqn.
\ref{eqn:atm_e}). The vapor pressure of air over water and ice was obtained using Eqn. \ref{eqn:vp}.  

\begin{equation}
	\epsilon_a=1.24 \cdot (\frac{p_{v,w}}{(T_a+273.15)})^{1/7} \label{eqn:atm_e}
\end{equation}

The software assumes $T_{ice} = 0 \degree C$ and ignores the influence of clouds in the atmospheric emissivity.
The first assumption overestimates $q_{LW}$ wherease the seond one underestimates it.  

\subsubsection{Turbulent fluxes} \label{sec:Qs}

The turbulent sensible $q_{S}$ and latent heat $q_{L}$ fluxes are computed with the following expressions
proposed by \cite{Garratt_1992}:

\begin{equation}
	q_{S}= c_{a} \cdot \rho_{a} \cdot p_{a}/p_{0,a} \cdot \frac{\kappa^2 \cdot v_a \cdot
		(T_a-T_{ice})}{{(\ln{\frac{h_{AWS}}{z_{0}}})}^2}
	\label{eqn:qs}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	q_{L}= 0.623 \cdot L_s \cdot \rho_{a}/p_{0,a} \cdot \frac{\kappa^2 \cdot
	v_a(p_{v,w}-p_{v,ice})}{{(\ln{\frac{h_{AWS}}{z_{0}}})}^2}
\end{equation}

where $h_{AWS}$ is the measurement height above the ground surface of the AWS (around $2\,m$ for all sites),
$v_a$ is the wind speed in [$m\,s^{-1}$], $c_a$ is the specific heat of air at constant pressure (1010 J
$kg^{-1} K^{-1}$), $\rho_{a}$ is the air density at standard sea level (1.29 $kg m^{-3}$), $p_{0,a}$ is the air
pressure at standard sea level (1013 $hPa$), $p_{a}$ is the measured air pressure, $\kappa$ is the von Karman
constant (0.4), $z_{0}$ is the surface roughness (3 $mm$) and $L_s$ is the heat of sublimation (2848
$kJ\,kg^{-1}$).  The vapor pressure of air with respect to water ($p_{v,w}$) and with respect to ice
($p_{v,ice}$) was obtained using the formulation given in \cite{huang_2018} :

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		p_{v,w}&=e^{\frac{(34.494 - \frac{4924.99}{T_{a} + 237.1})}{(T_a + 105)^{1.57} \cdot 100}} \cdot \frac{RH}{100} \\
		p_{v,ice}&=e^{\frac{(43.494 - \frac{6545.89}{T_{ice} + 278})}{(T_{ice} + 868)^{2} \cdot 100}} \\
	\end{split} \label{eqn:vp}
\end{equation}

The software ignores the $\mu_{cone}$ parameter thereby underestimating the turbulent fluxes.

\subsection{Automation equation}

Using the above simplifications, we can now approximate $q_{LW}$, $q_{L}$ and $q_{S}$ using just temperature, relative
humidity and wind speed.

Similarly, the diurnal variation of the shortwave radiation can be captured via a gaussian equation. However,
the seasonal variations in the amplitude of the solar radiation are poorly captured by such an equation. Since,
typical AIRs have a construction period spanning less than 3 months, we can ignore the seasonal variations of
solar radiation. Therefore, the net shortwave radiation $q_{SW}$ is computed as follows: 

% The automation equation is composed of two parts namely, (a) linear and (b) gaussian equation. (a)
% approximates the influence of temperature, wind speed and humidity on the expected freezing rate. (b)
% approximates the contribution of solar radiation on the expected freezing rates. 

\begin{subequations}

	\begin{align}
		\label{eq:T}
    \frac{(q_{LW} + q_{S} + q_{L}) \cdot A_{cone} \cdot \Delta t}{L_F} & = a \cdot T_a + b \cdot RH + c \cdot v_a +
  d \\
		\label{eq:SW}
    \frac{q_{SW} \cdot A_{cone} \cdot \Delta t}{L_F} & = \frac{amp}{(\sigma \sqrt{2\pi})} \cdot
    exp\left(\frac{-(time-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \\
		\label{eq:auto}
    \frac{(q_{freeze} + q_{melt}) \cdot A_{cone} \cdot \Delta t}{L_F} & = a \cdot T_a + b \cdot RH + c \cdot v_a + d
  +\frac{amp}{(\sigma \sqrt{2\pi})} \cdot exp\left(\frac{-(time-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
