\begin{abstract}

  Fountain scheduling can be used to improve Artificial Ice Reservoir (AIR) construction efficiency by reducing
  fountain wastewater production. Mass balance experiments have shown that over 80 \% of the water sprayed
  during traditional AIR construction can be lost. This result gives an indication of the potential improvement
  in water use efficiency that can be achieved by optimising the fountain discharge rate. Improved fountain
  scheduling was realized using an automation system that computes recommended discharge rates using real-time
  weather inputs and location metadata. During the winter of 2021-22, a traditional and an automated AIR were
  built in Guttannen with the main aim of comparing and quantifying the benefits of using automation systems.
  The scheduled fountain produced similar ice volumes while consuming 87 \% lesser water than the unscheduled
  fountain.  Overall, our results show that scheduled fountains can increase the water use efficiency and ice
  volume of AIR construction dramatically.

\introduction

In some arid mountain regions the lack of glacier meltwater is the main constraint on agricultural production.
As the area irrigated is often governed by the limited availability of water or labour to carry water, there is
much interest at the village level in adopting water storage techniques. One such technique that has gained many
users is called artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs). These AIRs are traditionally constructed by diverting glacial
streams into fountain spray systems via embankments and pipelines. However, traditional construction strategies
are prone to pipeline freezing events that increase the manual effort required to maintain the AIRs. Moreover,
this strategy uses unscheduled fountains that spray all the available water all the time thereby resulting in
low water use efficiency. Improvement of these construction strategies, therefore, will allow the farmers to
cultivate larger areas or to devote more time to other activities. 

Fountain scheduling methods are one option for reducing watering volumes for AIR construction systems and, at
the same time, increase water use efficiency. The goal of fountain scheduling is to make the most efficient use
of water by spraying the right amount of water at the right time, making sure water is available when the AIR
surface can freeze it. We expect scheduled fountains to produce higher water use efficiency since they produce
lower fountain wastewater. Additionally, lower fountain wastewater productions also lowers the melting energy
resulting in higher ice volumes.

However, it is unrealistic to schedule fountains manually due to two reasons. One, constant adjustments of
discharge rates in response to the significant diurnal and seasonal variations of the freezing rates is
impractical. Two, frequent pipeline water drainage required to prevent freezing events during scheduled fountain
disuse intervals is unfeasible. Therefore, operation of scheduled fountains via automation systems is preferred.

Proper fountain scheduling requires answers to two questions: (a) When should the water be turned on and off?
(b) How much water should be sprayed? Knowledge of surface freezing rates is important for answering these
questions. Surface freezing rates can be calculated by means of the full energy balance model developed in
\cite{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022} and \cite{oerlemansBriefCommunicationGrowth2021}.
However, in order to produce recommended discharge rates, we develop a simpler version of this energy balance
model that seeks a balance between model complexity and data availablity in order to produce recommended
discharge rates for the automation system efficiently.

The main interest in using model results is to simulate fountain schedules relative to various constrains in
monetary investments, construction duration as well as in water availability. The fountain scheduling strategies
are evaluated from the relative water use efficiency and maximum ice volume produced during the construction
period. The specific objectives of this paper include the presentation of the automation system and examples of
its application to the computation of fountain scheduling strategies.

\section{Study site and data}

The Guttannen site (46.66 $\degree$N, 8.29 $\degree$E) in the Bern region lies at 1047 $m$ a.s.l.. In the winter
(Oct-Apr), mean daily minimum and maximum air temperatures vary between -13 and 15 $\degree C$. Clear skies are
rare, averaging around 7 days during winter. Daily winter precipitation can sometimes be as high as 100 $mm$.
These values are based on 30 years of hourly weather model simulations \citep{guttannen}. Two AIRs were
constructed here by the Guttannen Bewegt Association respectively during the winters of 2020-21 using a
traditional and an automated construction strategy.

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Automated and traditional AIRs  at Guttannen on February 6, 2022. Picture credits: Daniel BÃ¼rki}
\label{fig:2AIR} 
\end{figure}

In order to compare both the construction strategies, the automated and the traditional AIRs were constructed
adjacent to each other as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:2AIR}. This ensured both AIRs shared the same water source
and similar weather patterns. In addition, a webcam guaranteed a continuous survey of the automated AIR.   

In the traditional strategy, tree branches were laid covering the fountain pipe to initiate the ice formation
process. The fountain discharge was maintained at maximum and its height was increased from 3 to 6\,$m$ during
the construction period.

In the automated strategy, only the fountain pipe was erected before initiation of water spray. An automation
system controlled the fountain discharge rate using real time weather input and several parameters exposed via
the user interface. 

\subsection{Meteorological data}
Air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, pressure, longwave, shortwave direct and diffuse radiation are
required to calculate the surface energy balance of an AIR (see Fig. \ref{fig:aws}). The construction period starts when the
fountain was first switched on and ends when the fountain was last switched off. These two dates are denoted as
start and fountain off dates henceforth.

\begin{figure*}[t]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/data.png}
\caption{Temperature, precipitation and discharge measurements at the Guttannen construction site}
\label{fig:aws} 
\end{figure*}

The weather data source was an automatic weather station (AWS) located around 20 meters away as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:2AIR}. Less than 0.4 \% of the data was found to be corrupted and these were filled by linear
interpolation. 

\subsection{Fountain observations}

We define the fountain used through four attributes; namely, its spray radius, discharge rate, height and water
temperature. The spray radius $r_F$ was estimated from the mean AIR circumference
measured in the drone surveys during the fountain runtime. 

The discharge rate of the scheduled fountain was measured by the automation system. The discharge of the
unscheduled fountain was estimated using the maximum discharge rate recorded by the automation system. This was
because the unscheduled fountain was spraying the maximum discharge rate for the whole construction period. But
the discharge rate of the unscheduled fountain also varied due to the increase in fountain height. We reduced
the discharge rate by half whenever there was a fountain height increase event since we observed a similar
reduction in magnitude for the scheduled fountain discharge rate.

Measurements of the discharge rate for the automated fountain were used to determine the discharge of the
traditional fountain. A new fountain design was used for the automated strategy since the traditional fountain
design was unable to function in the whole range of discharge rates suggested by the automation system.


\subsection{Drone surveys}

Several photogrammetric surveys were conducted on the traditional and the automated AIRs. The details of these
surveys and the methodology used to produce the corresponding outputs are explained in the Appendix. The digital
elevation maps (DEMs) generated from the obtained imagery were analysed to document the radius, surface area and
volume of the ice structures. The number of surveys conducted for the traditional and the automated AIRs were
6 and 3 respectively (see Table). The last drone flight was used to set the dome volume for the traditional AIR.
The dome volume for the automated AIR represented the snow volume found before the fountain was switched on. The
remaining surveys were used for model validation.

\subsection{Bulk temperature measurements}

Eight thermistors recorded temperature variations across the interior of the Automated Guttannen AIR. 

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Automation system}

\subsubsection{Automation hardware}

The automation system implements fountain scheduling strategies for the twin objectives of ice volume (ICV) and
water use efficiency (WUE). The ice volume objective is suitable in locations with sufficient water volumes to
freeze during the construction period. The water use efficiency objective is suitable in locations with
favourable weather conditions constrained by available water supply. For the ICV objective, the model
assumptions overestimate the freezing rate whereas for the WUE objective the model assumptions underestimate the
freezing rate. 

The automation hardware consists of a weather station, flowmeter, control valve, drain valves, air valves,
fountain, pipeline and a logger. The logger feeds the weather station data to the automation software and
informs the recommended discharge rate to the flowmeter. The flowmeter adjusts the control valve to match the
recommendation. However, the recommended discharge rate is ignored if any of the termination criterions are
valid. The termination criterions prevent water loss and pipeline freezing events. In case a termination
criteria is valid, the drain and air valves empty the water in the pipeline.

\subsubsection{Automation software}

The software uses several assumptions to reduce the data requirement of the energy balance model. The
assumptions are categorised into two kinds based on whether they favour higher water use efficiency or ice
volumes and are described in the Appendix and summarised in Table \ref{tab:assumptions}.  

\begin{table}[]

\multicolumn{1}{|l}{Longwave Radiation}  & $q_{LW}$ & $cld = 0$ ; $T_{ice} = 0$ & $cld = 1$ ; $T_{ice} = 0$ & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{} \\ \midrule

\multicolumn{1}{|l}{Fountain discharge heat flux} & $q_{F}$ & 0 & 0 & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{} \\ \midrule
\multicolumn{1}{|l}{Ground heat flux}    & $q_{G}$ & 0 & 0 & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Using the simplifications shown in Table \ref{tab:assumptions}, we can compute the expected freezing rate or
recommeded discharge rates using the following set of equations:

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\label{eqn:T}
   \frac{q_{SW} + q_{LW} + q_{S}}{\rho_w \cdot L_F} + \frac{q_L}{\rho_w \cdot L_V} & \approx f(hod, T_a, RH,
   v_a) \\
		\label{eqn:auto}
  Q_{F} & \approx f(hod, T_a, RH, v_a) \cdot \pi r_{F}^2 \cdot
  \frac{1000}{60}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $r_F$ is the fountain spray radius, $Q_{F}$ is the discharge rate, f is the simplified energy balance
function and $hod$ is the hour of day.

Equation \ref{eqn:auto} is implemented in the automation system through a user interface that enables input of
the spray radius, altitude, latitude and longitude of the construction location. Once switched on, the
automation system regulates the fountain discharge rate based on the recommended discharge rate. However,
certain termination criterias override the discharge rate recommendation to prevent water loss and pipeline
freezing events, namely: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Loss of water droplets due to high wind speed are avoided by introducing a wind speed limit 

\item Pipeline freezing events due to very cold conditions are avoided by setting a minimum temperature limit 

\item Pipeline damage is avoided by draining the pipeline upon a pipeline freezing event detection. Pipeline
  freezing events are assumed if $Q_F = 0$ for atleast 20 seconds.

\item Water loss is avoided by detection of pipeline leakage/damage. Pipeline leakage is assumed if $Q_F > Q_{leak}$. 

\item Pipeline freezing events are prevented by ignoring low discharge rate recommendations  

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Calibration}
We retain the default values of all parameters used in
\cite{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022} for our analysis.  

In addition, we also parametrise two model variables, namely, fountain water temperature ($T_F$) and AIR density
($\rho_{AIR}$). Both these parameters were assumed to be constant in the previous versions of the model. With
the extended measurement dataset of CH22 AIR, we could estimate the water temperature parameter by assuming it
is equal to our ground temperature measurements but only when the air temperature was not subzero. Under subzero
conditions, the water droplets are likely to cool to 0 C during their flight time. Therefore, the fountain water
temperature was instead determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
	T_{F} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		0 & \textit{ if } T_{temp} < 0 \\
		T_{G} & \textit{ otherwise}
	\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

where $T_{G}$ is the measured ground temperature.

The snowfall mass input of CH22 AIR was comparable to the mass input via the fountain discharge. Therefore, we
could no longer assume that the AIR density was equal to ice density. We instead parameterised AIR density
$\rho_{AIR}$ as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \rho_{AIR} = \frac{M_{F} + M_{dep} + M_{ppt}}{(M_{F} + M_{dep})/\rho_{ice} + M_{ppt}/\rho_{snow}}
\end{equation}

where $M_F$ is the cumulative mass of the fountain discharge; $M_{ppt}$ is the cumulative precipitation;
$M_{dep}$ is the cumulative accumulation through water vapour deposition; $\rho_{ice}$ is the ice density (917
$kg\,m^{-3}$) and $\rho_{snow}$ is the density of wet snow (300 $kg\,m^{-3}$) taken from
\cite{cuffeyPhysicsGlaciers2010} .

\subsection{Validation}
We performed the validation of the physical model on the two different AIRs using two different datasets namely,
AIR mean temperature and ice volume measurements. This was because there were fewer successful ice volume
measurements for the automated AIR due to lack of features on the snow covered structure. Meanwhile, the traditional
AIR being steeper exposed ice features that resulted in more ice volume measurements but it did not have a AIR
mean temperature dataset. Therefore, the calibrated physical model was tested using the hourly AIR mean temperature
measurements for the automated AIR and the ice volume measurements for the traditional AIR respectively. Root
mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient served as the evaluation metric in both the cases. Hourly
AIR mean temperature measurements were produced from the mean of all the six thermistor measurements located at the
interior of the AIR throughout the construction duration. Mean AIR temperature was estimated to be the modelled
average of surface temperature $T_{ice}$ and bulk temperature $T_{bulk}$. Ice volume was recorded using several
drone surveys as shown in Table \ref{tab:uav}.

The performance of the ICV and WUE versions of the physical model was assessed by comparing its discharge rate
estimates with the validated freezing rate of the calibrated physical model.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Energy balance model validation}
The physical model achieved an RMSE of $4 \degree C$ with the AIR mean temperature measurements of the automated
AIR and an RMSE of $m^3$ with the ice volume measurements of the traditional AIR. The estimated and measured AIR
mean temperatures and ice volumes are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:validation}
 
\begin{figure*}[t] 
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Figures/validation.png} 
  \caption{Bulk temperature and ice volume validation of the scheduled and unscheduled fountain construction strategies.} 
\label{fig:validation} 
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Scheduled discharge rate estimation}

We found that the simplified energy balance model could estimate the freezing rate of the unscheduled fountain
with a correlation higher that 0.5 and RMSE less than 1 $l/min$ for both the ICV and WUE objectives. The
ICV scheduled fountain overestimated the freezing rate 90 \% of the construction duration whereas the WUE
scheduled fountain underestimated the freezing rate 80 \% of the construction duration as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig:freezing_rate}.

\begin{figure*}[t]

\caption{Scheduled discharge rate estimates of the simplified energy balance model with the WUE and ICV
assumptions compared with the validated freezing rate of the full energy balance model.}
\label{fig:freezing_rate}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Comparison of AIR construction strategies}

Given the excessive discharge rate of the unscheduled fountain, it is not surprising that its fountain
wastewater output is an order of magnitude higher than the scheduled fountain. But given the lower measured
volume of the traditional AIR, it is unexpected that it corresponds to a higher ice mass. This is because the
lower snowfall input of the traditional AIR made it more dense than the automated AIR (see Table \ref{tab:mb}).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Simulations of scheduled fountains}

We evaluate the benefits of the automated construction strategies by comparing them with the traditional
construction strategies used in the IN21 and CH21 locations presented in
\cite{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022}. The difference in water use efficiency and maximum
ice volumes expected between unscheduled and scheduled fountains in the three locations are presented in Fig.
\ref{fig:wue}.

\begin{figure*}[t]

\conclusions
In this paper, an automated AIR construction strategy is presented and compared with a traditional strategy
using data collected in Guttannen, Switzerland.

The main purpose of this study was to test the idea that scheduled AIR fountains could lead to a significant
improvement in water use efficiency and ice volumes. A simplified energy balance model compatible with the
limited data availability of a new location was used to produce recommended discharge rate. Nevertheless, this
model was able to capture more than 65 \% of the freezing rate variations produced by the full energy balance
model.

The automation system allows the easy handling of fountain scheduling implementation. The possibility for
changing the location and fountain metadata directly in the user interface allows tailoring the fountain
discharge rate according to the location's water supply and weather conditions. Furthermore, this construction
strategy reduces the occurence of pipeline freezing events as it drains the pipeline whenever fountain is not in
use.

Nevertheless, the real world application of this method is challenging. It is clear that if improvements are to
be achieved, future research must be devoted to modelling the impact of fountain design on the spray radius.

\appendix

\section{Simplified energy balance model}

We approximate the energy balance at the surface of an AIR by a one-dimensional description of energy fluxes as
used in \cite{balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022}. The ice volume evolution of the AIR can be
represented as: 

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta V_{ice}}{\Delta t}  =  \frac{\Delta j_{cone}}{ \Delta t} \cdot A_{cone}
	\label{eqn:freeze}
\end{equation}

where $\frac{\Delta j_{cone}}{\Delta t}$ is the thickness change determined as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta j_{cone}}{\Delta t}  = \frac{1}{\rho_{AIR}} \cdot (\frac{q_{SW} + q_{LW} + q_{S} + q_{F} + q_{G} -
  q_{T}}{L_F} + \frac{q_{L}}{L_V} )
	\label{eqn:freeze}
\end{equation}

Upward and downward fluxes relative to the ice surface are positive and negative, respectively. The first term
represents the surface thickness change rate due to freezing of the fountain water and melting of the ice.
$q_{SW}$ is the net shortwave radiation; $q_{LW}$ is the net longwave radiation; $q_{L}$ and $q_{S}$ are the
turbulent latent and sensible heat fluxes; $q_{F}$ is the fountain heat flux; $q_{G}$ is the ground heat flux
and $q_{T}$ is the temperature heat flux. However, we assume $q_{F}$, $q_{G}$ and $q_{T}$ to be negligible.

The data requirement was reduced by estimating the global shortwave radiation and pressure directly using the
location's coordinates and altitude through the solar radiation model described in
\citet{holmgrenPvlibPythonPython2018}. The algorithm used to estimate the clear-sky global radiation is
described in \citet{ineichenBroadbandSimplifiedVersion2008}.  

The model complexity was reduced through assumptions that optimise for the ice volume objective or the water use
efficiency objective. Assumptions are chosen based on whether they overestimate/underestimate the freezing rate.
Ice volume objective requires freezing rate to be overestimated whereas WUE objective requires freezing rate to
be underestimated. We describe these two kinds of assumptions applied on each of the energy balance components
below: 

\subsection{Surface Area $A_{cone}$ assumptions}

Since we are only interested in determination of the surface area during the accumulation period we can assume a
constant ice cone radius equal to the fountain spray radius. The surface area scales the freezing rate of the
AIR. Hence, for the ICV objective we assume the maximum possible slope of 1 for the ice cone or in other words
$h_{cone} = r_{F}$. Therefore, area is estimated as:  

\begin{equation} A_{cone} =\pi \cdot r_{F}^2 \label{eq:Area} \end{equation}

Similarly, for the WUE objective, the area of the conical AIR is approximated to the area of its circular
base.Therefore, area is estimated as:

\begin{equation} A_{cone} =\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi \cdot r_{F}^2 \label{eq:Area} \end{equation}

\subsection{Net shortwave radiation \texorpdfstring{$q_{SW}$}{Lg} assumptions}
\label{sec:SW}

The net shortwave radiation $q_{SW}$ is computed as follows:

\begin{equation} 
q_{SW} = (1- \alpha) \cdot ( SW_{direct} \cdot f_{cone} + SW_{diffuse})
\label{eqn:SW} 
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the albedo value ; $SW_{direct}$ is the direct shortwave radiation; $SW_{diffuse}$ is the
diffuse shortwave radiation and $f_{cone}$ is the solar area fraction.

The diffuse and direct shortwave radiation is determined using the estimated global solar radiation as follows:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  SW_{diffuse} &= cld \cdot SW_{global}\\
  SW_{direct} &= (1-cld) \cdot SW_{global}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $cld$ is the cloudiness factor. $cld$ is assumed to be 1 and 0 for the WUE and iceV objective
respectively.

We ignore the variations in the albedo and assume it to be equal to snow albedo and ice albedo for the iceV and
WUE objective respectively. 

The solar area fraction $f_{cone}$ of the ice structure exposed to the direct shortwave radiation depends on the
shape considered. It is computed as

\begin{equation}
		f_{cone} =\frac{(0.5 \cdot r_{cone} \cdot h_{cone}) \cdot cos \theta_{sun} +(\pi \cdot
			{(r_{cone})}^2/2) \cdot sin \theta_{sun} }{\pi \cdot r_{cone} \cdot ({(r_{cone})}^2+{(h_{cone})}^2)^{1/2}}\\
\end{equation}

For the ICV objective, since we assume the slope of the cone to be 1 $f_{cone}$ is determined
as follows:

\begin{equation}
		f_{cone} =\frac{ cos \theta_{sun} + \pi \cdot sin \theta_{sun} }{2\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi }
\end{equation}

Similarly, for the WUE objective, since we assume the slope of the cone to be negligible, we get:

\begin{equation}
		f_{cone} =\frac{ sin \theta_{sun} }{2 }
\end{equation}

\subsection{Net Longwave radiation \texorpdfstring{$q_{LW}$}{Lg} assumptions} \label{sec:LW}

We assume $T_{ice} = 0 \degree C$ in order to determine outgoing longwave radiation. Since it is challenging to
contrain the minimum ice temperature, we maintain this assumption for both our objectives. However, in order to
estimate atmospheric emissivity we again assume $cld$ to be 1 and 0 for the WUE and iceV objective respectively.

\subsection{Turbulent fluxes assumptions} \label{sec:Qs}

Turbulent fluxes estimation depend on the slope of the cone through the $\mu_{cone}$ parameter. As suggested 
by \citet{oerlemansBriefCommunicationGrowth2021}, we can estimate this parameter as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \mu_{cone} =1 + s_{cone}/2
\end{equation}

Hence, the $\mu_{cone}$ parameter takes values of 1.5 and 1 for the iceV and WUE objective respectively.  Since
turbulent fluxes impact both the freezing and the melting rates, this assumption may not favor the corresponding
objectives for certain sites.
