  abstract = {The hydrograph separation method, previously proposed to quantify base flow, seasonal snowmelt, and glacial melt components in river flows within Upper Indus basin underestimates glacial melt component. This is particularly limiting for highly glacierized watersheds. The limitation has been corrected by a further refinement of the method. The results with the refined procedure are highly consistent with the physical characteristics such as hypsometry and glacier extents of the watershed even though the method itself is completely independent of the physical characteristics of the watershed where it is applied. Glacial melt far outweigh snowmelt in the rivers draining the Karakoram and Zanskar ranges. In the Karakoram, on an annualized basis, glacial melt proportion varies from 43\% to 50\% whereas snowmelt varies from 27\% to 31\%. On the other hand, snowmelt dominates over glacial melt in the rivers draining the western Greater Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. Here snowmelt percentage in river discharge varies from 31\% to 53\% whereas that of glacial melt ranges from 16\% to 30\%. In the main stem of Upper Indus River, snowmelt fraction in most cases is slightly greater than the glacial melt fraction. In the main stem, snowmelt percentage ranges from 35\% to 44\% whereas glacial melt percentage ranges from 25\% to 36\%. Upper Indus River just upstream of Tarbela Reservoir carries annual flows constituted of 70\% melt water of which 26\% is contributed by glacial melts and 44\% by snowmelts. We also show that during the later part of twentieth century and continuing into the early part of twenty first century glacial melt contributions to river discharge has decreased compared to the previous decades. This phenomenon can be ascribed to either basin wide loss of glacial mass in the recent decades in the elevation range from where most of the glacial melt originates or glacier growth and stability due to either reduction in energy inputs or increase in precipitation or both at the high altitude bands wherefrom glacial melt water originates.},

In this paper, an autonomous approach is proposed in order to improve the low efficiency of irrigation by developing a system based on the water requirement of the plantations, through field data. The data are local temperature, local wind, soil moisture, precipitation forecast, and soil evapotranspiration calculation. This information enables the system to calculate the real evapotranspiration for not being necessary to restrict to lysimetric measures. By this way, the system schedules the irrigation for the lower cost periods, considering the produced energy by the local resources, and the price of energy purchased from the utility grid. Also, it is considered that the irrigation must be carried out within the time interval in which the plantations do not reach the wilding point, so it will be carried out at the periods with the lowest cost. This will optimize the overall operational costs of the irrigation.},

Cryospheric and hydrological changes in combination with socio-economic development are threatening downstream water security triggering the need for effective adaptation responses. Here, we present a global systematic review (83 peer-reviewed articles) that assesses different water-related stressors and the adaptation responses to manage water stress in major glaciated mountain regions. Globally, agriculture (42\%), tourism (12\%), hydropower (8\%) and health and safety (4\%) are among the main sectors affected by hydrological and cryospheric changes . A broad set of adaptation measures has already been implemented in the world's mountain regions. We find that globally the most commonly used adaptation practices correspond to the improvement of water storage infrastructure (13\%), green infrastructure (9.5\%), agricultural practices (17\%), water governance and policies (21\%), disaster risk reduction (9.5\%) and economic diversification (10\%). Successful implementation of adaptation measures is limited by reduced stakeholder capacities, collaboration and financial resources, and policies and development. To overcome these limitations, funding for climate change adaptation and development programmes in mountains and trust-building measures such as shared stakeholder activities need to be strengthened. Local awareness raising of both, the adverse effects of climate change and potentially positive implications of specific adaptation measures can help to support successful adaptation.},

The communities of Himalayan mountains are facing challenges of food security owing to lack of the resource information for meeting their water requirements. In this study, suitability index approach was adopted to assess glacier resource potential for establishing kuhl irrigation system in HKH ranges of Pakistan. The basis of indexing is glacier accessibility and water yield potential of the glacial resource for irrigation estimated in terms of number and ice reserve of the glaciers. The suitability index was found good for about 1.4\% glaciers constituting about 80\% of the total ice reserves of the HKH region. Medium suitability constitutes about 36.1\% glaciers with 12.6\% of the total ice reserves, while low suitability was assessed for about 60\% glaciers containing 1.5\% ice reserves only. Maximum unit glacial reserve was estimated for Shigar basin, i.e., 1.44\,km3, and among HKH ranges, 0.46\,km3 for the Karakoram range. A regular monitoring of the glacial resource would prove helpful in assessing vulnerability of this resource to climate change in the high Himalayan region in future.},

  abstract = {Since 2014, mountain communities in Ladakh, India have been constructing dozens of Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) by spraying water through fountain systems every winter. The meltwater from these structures is crucial to meet irrigation water demands during spring. However, there is a large variability associated with this water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen location. This study compared the ice volume evolution of an AIR built in Ladakh, India with two others built in Guttannen, Switzerland using a surface energy balance model. Model input consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain discharge rate (mass input of an AIR). Model calibration and validation were completed using ice volume and surface area measurements taken from several drone surveys. The model was successful in estimating the observed ice volume evolution with a root mean square error within 18               \%               of the maximum ice volume for all the AIRs. The location in Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four times larger compared to the Guttannen site. However, the corresponding water losses for all the AIRs were more than three-quarters of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain wastewater. Drier and colder locations in relatively cloud-free regions are expected to produce long-lasting AIRs with higher maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain regions, where AIR technology could provide a relatively affordable and sustainable strategy to mitigate climate change induced water stress.},

  abstract = {Snow, glaciers and permafrost translate fluctuations of atmospheric conditions and highlight current environmental changes. Monitoring of these changes is one of the major objectives of the international climate observation strategy developed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Under ongoing climate change, the implication of altering meltwater released by snow, ice and permafrost will become increasingly relevant for the fragile mountain and lowland environments of Central Asia. These changes will affect the livelihood, particularly for mountain communities but also for the highly populated regions downstream. A degrading cryosphere may cause drastic ecological changes and endanger water, food and health security leading to pronounced political instabilities and changing socio-hydrological interactions. For successful mitigation, the adaptation capacity has to be enforced by first creating basic observational datasets on the state and changes of the cryosphere, and secondly, by providing well-calibrated models in connection with climate scenario output. This information is a pre-condition to reduce on mid- to long-term the vulnerability of the local population. So far, significant data gaps of in situ measurements in Central Asia, mainly from the mid-1990~s to around 2010 impeded sound interpretations of long-term trends in the cryosphere. However, the progress made on glacier observation and capacity building in recent years, promises a future perspective for monitoring including snow and permafrost. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on the state of three essential climate variables (ECV) of the Central Asian cryosphere: snow, glaciers and permafrost in a context of future water security. It highlights the challenges for cryosphere assessments in the region and discusses ongoing monitoring efforts, future directions and emerging approaches, which might address current shortcomings of today's monitoring network.},

  abstract = {Microirrigation techniques can be used to improve irrigation efficiency on vegetable gardens by reducing soil evaporation and drainage losses and by creating and maintaining soil moisture conditions that are favourable to crop growth. Water balance experiments in Zimbabwe showed that over 50\% of the water applied as surface irrigation on traditional irrigated gardens can be lost as soil evaporation. This result gives an indication of the potential improvement in irrigation efficiency that can be achieved by adopting irrigation methods that reduce soil evaporation at the same time as minimising losses due to drainage and canopy interception. During the period 1985 to 1995, irrigation trials and experiments were carried out in south-east Zimbabwe and northern Sri Lanka with the main aim of comparing and quantifying the benefits of using simple microirrigation techniques on traditional vegetable gardens. This paper reviews the results of these trials and experiments. Microirrigation techniques that were evaluated included low-head drip irrigation, pitcher irrigation and subsurface irrigation using clay pipes. Of these methods, subsurface irrigation using clay pipes was found to be particularly effective in improving yields, crop quality and water use efficiency as well as being cheap, simple and easy to use. The comparative advantages of subsurface irrigation were maintained for a range of crops grown under different climatic conditions. Good results were also obtained with subsurface irrigation when irrigation was carried out using with poor quality irrigation water.},

However, high altitude glacio-hydrological observations and investigations to address the linkage between the timing of glacier changes and river runoff fluctuations remain ambiguous, particularly in the northwestern Himalayan region of Pakistan. In this context, the hydrological regime of the Astore Basin, a sub-catchment of the Upper Indus River Basin, was comprehensively investigated by employing in situ hydro-meteorological observations in combination with satellite remote sensing data. Two-thirds of the annual precipitation in the Astore Basin falls in winter and spring, mainly deposited by westerly winds, whereas summer and autumn precipitation deposited by the monsoon and local jet streams accounts for only one-third. Some 14~\% of the basin area is covered by glaciers and, added to the accumulated seasonal snow deposited by westerly circulations, this can reach 80\textendash 85~\% of the basin area. Therefore more than 75~\% of the annual basin runoff depends on melt-water produced by the predominant seasonal snow and glacier ablation. The non-parametric Mann\textendash Kendall trend test was applied to the whole time-series of hydro-meteorological data. This indicated a lowering of annual and summer mean temperatures during the period 1980\textendash 1995 and slight warming during the 1996\textendash 2010 period. Similarly, annual, winter and summer precipitation, and annual mean discharge, increased from 1980 to 1995 but, in contrast, a slight decrease in annual and summer precipitation was observed during the 1996\textendash 2010 period; however, discharge evidence is slight making any increase in this period insignificant. In addition, the Spearman and Mann\textendash Kendall correlation results depict annual stream flow fluctuations during the 1980\textendash 2010 decades in the Astore River that were predominantly influenced by precipitation variations, but not by any alteration in catchment temperatures, and so not governed by enhanced glacier ablation and retreat. The results of the analysis presented here were also substantiated by satellite remote sensing investigation, which points to evidence of stable conditions in the Astore Basin glaciers during this period.},

It is a conceptual non-distributed water balance model for simulating crop irrigation schedules at field level and to compute irrigation requirements under optimal and/or water stressed conditions. To provide for the use of the model at the project scale, a new version of the model, integrated with a Geographical Information System (GIS), was developed. This GIS based application is aimed at supporting the implementation of improved farm irrigation management and, in a later phase, to also help project management. The integration concerns the creation of spatial and weather GIS databases usable by ISAREG, the models operation for different water management scenarios, and the production of crop irrigation maps and time dependent irrigation depths at selected aggregation modes, including the farm scale. The resulting information on alternative irrigation schedules is, therefore, spatially distributed and shall be used both to support irrigation scheduling advising and to help in the identification of practices that may lead to water saving and provide for salinity control. The paper includes brief descriptions of the models, the databases and the integration of the models, as well as main features of the GISAREG application. Results relative to the comparative analysis of irrigation scheduling scenarios show the capabilities of the model to support the selection of water saving alternatives. The appropriateness of implementing 15\textendash 20-day time intervals between irrigations is shown. In addition, results relative to compare net irrigation requirements for wet and dry years show the usefulness of the model in handling time series of weather data.},

  abstract = {We investigate the performance of five glacier melt models over a multi-decadal period in order to assess their ability to model future glacier response. The models range from a simple degree-day model, based solely on air temperature, to more-sophisticated models, including the full shortwave radiation balance. In addition to the empirical models, the performance of a physically based energy-balance (EB) model is examined. The melt models are coupled to an accumulation and a surface evolution model and applied in a distributed manner to Rhonegletscher, Switzerland, over the period 1929\textendash 2012 at hourly resolution. For calibration, seasonal mass-balance measurements (2006\textendash 12) are used. Decadal ice volume changes for six periods in the years 1929\textendash 2012 serve for model validation. Over the period 2006\textendash 12, there are almost no differences in performance between the models, except for EB, which is less consistent with observations, likely due to lack of meteorological in situ data. However, simulations over the long term (1929\textendash 2012) reveal that models which include a separate term for shortwave radiation agree best with the observed ice volume changes, indicating that their melt relationships are robust in time and thus suitable for long-term modelling, in contrast to more empirical approaches that are oversensitive to temperature fluctuations.},

While the current snow cover distribution on the slopes is often well known thanks to the usage of advanced monitoring techniques, information about its future evolution is usually lacking. Management-enabled numerical snowpack models driven by meteorological forecasts can help to fill this gap. In the frame of the H2020 project PROSNOW, the snowpack models AMUNDSEN, Crocus, and SNOWPACK/Alpine3D are applied in nine pilot ski resorts across the European Alps for forecasting snow conditions in time scales from days to several months ahead. We present the integration of detailed snowmaking and grooming practices implemented in the three models and show how they can be adapted to individual ski resorts. An ensemble of snow management configurations accounting for a comprehensive set of possible tactical and strategic operational choices is introduced, along with an approach to homogeneously spatialize the results of the three snow models over different areas of the ski resorts. First simulation results are presented for the nine pilot ski resorts in the form of distributed snow water equivalent (SWE) maps along with SWE and snow depth time series for two selected seasons in the past.},

The dependence of the directional emissivity on the surface snow type (grain size and shape) was examined. We obtained emissivity spectra for five different surface types, i.e., fine dendrite snow, medium granular snow, coarse grain snow, welded sun crust snow, and smooth bare ice. The derived emissivities show a distinct spectral contrast at wavelengths {$\lambda$}=10.5\textendash 12.5 {$\mu$}m which is enhanced with increasing the snow grain size. For example, emissivities at both 10.5 {$\mu$}m and 12.5 {$\mu$}m for the nadir angle were 0.997 and 0.984 for the fine dendrite snow, 0.996 and 0.974 for the medium granular snow, 0.995 and 0.971 for the coarse grain snow, 0.992 and 0.968 for the sun crust, and 0.993 and 0.949 for the bare ice, respectively. In addition, the spectral contrast exhibits a strong angular dependence, particularly for the coarser snow and bare ice, e.g., the emissivity at {$\lambda$}=12.5 {$\mu$}m for the off-nadir angle of 75\textdegree{} reaches down to 0.927, 0.896, and 0.709 for the coarse grain snow, sun crust, and bare ice cases, respectively. The angular dependent emissivity spectra of the bare ice were quite consistent with the spectra predicted by the Fresnel reflectance theory. The observed results firmly demonstrate that the directional emissivity of snow in the TIR can vary depending upon the surface snow type. The high variability of the spectral emissivity of snow also suggests the possibility to discriminate between snow and ice types from space using the brightness temperature difference in the atmospheric window.},

However, ice cliff contribution is difficult to quantify as they are highly dynamic features, and the paucity of observations of melt rates and their variability leads to large modeling uncertainties. We quantify monsoon season melt and 3D evolution of four ice cliffs over two debris-covered glaciers in High Mountain Asia (Langtang Glacier, Nepal, and 24 K Glacier, Tibet) at very high resolution using terrestrial photogrammetry applied to imagery captured from time-lapse cameras installed on lateral moraines. We derive weekly flow-corrected DEMs of the glacier surface with an estimated uncertainty of +/- 0.2 m for Langtang Glacier and +/- 0.06 m for 24 K Glacier and use change detection to determine distributed melt rates at the surfaces of the ice cliffs throughout the study period. We compare the measured melt patterns with those derived from a 3D energy balance model to derive the contribution of the main energy fluxes. We find that ice cliff melt varies considerably throughout the melt season, with maximum melt rates of 5 to 8 cm.day\textsuperscript{-1}, which is 3 to 38 times higher than the melt rates of the surrounding debris-covered ice. Our results highlight the influence of redistributed supraglacial debris on cliff melt. At both sites, ice cliff albedo is influenced by the presence of thin debris at the ice cliff surface, which is largely controlled on 24 K Glacier by liquid precipitation events that wash away this debris. Slightly thicker or patchy debris reduces melt by 1\&ndash;2 cm.day\textsuperscript{-}1 at all sites. Ultimately, our observations show a strong variability in cliff area, which is controlled by supraglacial streams and ponds and englacial cavities that promote debris slope destabilization and the lateral expansion of the cliffs. These findings highlight the need to better represent processes of debris redistribution in ice cliff models, to in turn improve estimates of ice cliff contribution to glacier melt and the long-term geomorphological evolution of debris-covered glacier surfaces.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In semiarid regions where water resources are scarce, irrigation water use efficiency is an important issue. Although subsurface drip irrigation is a very efficient irrigation method, it has had relatively limited expansion due to several disadvantages such as the clogging of emitters and the difficulty of detecting leakages and repairing them. Recently, an alternative subsurface irrigation method that is able to avoid most of the aforementioned drawbacks has been introduced in southern Spain. The objective of this work is to assess the performance of this method and to compare it to a surface drip-irrigation system. To achieve this objective, a three-year field experiment was carried out in an organic olive orchard (Olea europaea L.) located in the province of Almer\'ia, Spain. The water-use efficiency of both irrigation methods was analyzed under three different irrigation water supplies. The results show that the alternative subsurface irrigation method seems to perform better than the drip irrigation one because the yield and the irrigation water use efficiency were higher for the first one.

There are different engineering solutions as integral part of water shed management: diversion canal, water reservoir, gravity canal, lift irrigation scheme, and snow harvesting.

The system of water distribution during the farming season is strictly followed by the people in their respective villages. Artificial glacier technique is used in the area from 1987. The main stream water is diverted by constructing a long channel made of dry stonewall across the hill slopes to the glacier site. The length, breadth and depth of the channel vary with the slope of the hill as well as an estimated flow of the stream. Dry stone retaining walls and a suitable bed grade to smoothen the follow of water protect the channel from damage. The stone wall is made of locally available stone and a mix of organic manure and soft soil.

The aims of the present study are threefold: to map the glaciers of central and eastern Ladakh, to describe their regional distribution and characteristics in relation to size and topography, and to analyze glacier changes in the selected ranges over the past five decades. The study is based on multi-temporal remote sensing data (Corona and Landsat), supported and validated by several field campaigns carried out between 2007 and 2016. A glacier inventory was carried out for the complete study area, which was subdivided into nine sub-regions for comparison. In general, the glaciers of Ladakh are characterized by their high altitude, as 91\% terminate above 5200 m, and by their relatively small size, as 79\% of them are smaller than 0.75 km2 and only 4\% are larger than 2 km2. The glaciated area of central Ladakh totaled 997 km2 with more than 1800 glaciers in 2002.},

  abstract = {To sustain productive irrigated agriculture with limited water resources requires a high water use efficiency. This can be achieved by the precise scheduling of deficit irrigation systems taking into account the crops' response to water stress at different stages of plant growth. Particularly in the light of climate change with rising population numbers and increasing water scarcity, an optimal solution for this task is of paramount importance. We solve the corresponding complex multidimensional and nonlinear optimization problem, i.e., finding the ideal schedule for maximum crop yield with a given water volume by a well tailored approach which offers straightforward application facilities. A global optimization technique allows, together with physically based modeling, for the risk assessment in yield reduction considering different sources of uncertainty (e.g., climate, soil conditions, and management). A new stochastic framework for decision support is developed which aims at optimal climate change adaption strategies in irrigation. It consists of: (1) a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate change; (2) a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply; and (3) mechanistic models for rigorously simulating water transport and crop growth. The result, namely, stochastic crop-water production functions, allows to assess the impact of climate variability on potential yield and thus provides a valuable tool for estimating minimum water demands for irrigation in water resources planning and management, assisting furthermore in generating maps of yield uncertainty for specific crops and specific agricultural areas. The tool is successfully applied at an experimental site in southern France. The impacts of predicted climate variability on maize are discussed.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in electromagnetic sensor technologies have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing devices. However, many of the available guidelines for sensor placement were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. Sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting irrigation efficiency. This study investigates how soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems under various conditions. For this purpose several numerical experiments were carried out using a mathematical model, incorporating a system-dependent boundary condition in order to simulate soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems. The results of this study provided clear evidence that soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation efficiency in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. In specific cases the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was as high as 16\%; however, when nearby sensor positions were examined, the observed differences were generally low. The effect of sensors accuracy was even clearer. For the lower sensor's error level studied ({$\pm$}0.01cm3cm-3) the effect on irrigation efficiency ranged between 2.5\% and 6.4\%, while for the higher error level ({$\pm$}0.03cm3cm-3) the effect ranged between 10.2\% and 18.7\%. These results highlight the importance of a detailed study taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation, and scheduling systems as well as soil moisture sensors in order to provide a sound basis for improved irrigation scheduling. The need for soil specific calibration of the sensors used in such systems is highlighted as well. Lastly, a significant outcome of this study is the ability of computer models to serve as efficient tools for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning and accuracy, or other automated scheduling system characteristics.},

One is the commonly used and conceptually simple Soil Conservation Service curve number method. The other is a process oriented model based on the Green and Ampt equation. The Green and Ampt model employs newly developed techniques for parameterizing the Green and Ampt equation based on readily available soil and vegetation information. Annual, monthly and daily predicted runoff were compared to observed on six uncalibrated rangeland catchments located in Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Nebraska and Idaho. Model parameterization was based strictly on individual catchment characteristics. No model calibration was performed. Results indicate that the Green and Ampt model is a potentially useful tool for predicting runoff. These results are important because they demonstrate the utility of complex physically based models as management tools for predicting land use impacts to runoff and infiltration.},

The two main rivers of Amu Darya and Syr Darya and their tributaries comprise the Aral Sea Basin area and are the lifeline for about 70 million inhabitants in Central Asia. Written by regional and international experts, this book critically examines the current state, trends and future of water resources management and development in this major part of the Central Asia region. It brings together insights on the history of water management in the region, surface and groundwater assessment, issues of transboundary water management and environmental degradation and restoration, and an overview of the importance of water for the key economic sectors and overall socio-economic development of Central Asian countries, as well as of hydro politics in the region. The book also focusses on the future of water sector development in the Basin, including a review of local and international actors, as well as an analysis of the current status and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals by Basin countries. The book will be essential reading for those interested in sea basin management, environmental policy in Central Asia and water resource management more widely. It will also act as a reference source for decision-makers in state agencies, as well as a background source of information for NGOs.

Retreating and thinning glaciers are icons of climate change3 and affect regional runoff4 as well as global sea level5,6. In past~reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, estimates of changes in glacier mass were based on the multiplication of averaged or interpolated results from available observations of a few hundred glaciers by defined regional glacier areas7\textendash 10. For data-scarce regions, these results had to be complemented with estimates based on satellite altimetry and gravimetry11. These past approaches were challenged by the small number and heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of in situ measurement series and their often unknown ability to represent their respective mountain ranges, as well as by the spatial limitations of satellite altimetry (for which only point data are available) and gravimetry (with its coarse resolution). Here we use an extrapolation of glaciological and geodetic observations to show that glaciers contributed 27~{$\pm~$}22~millimetres to global mean sea-level rise from 1961 to 2016. Regional~specific-mass-change rates for 2006\textendash 2016 range from -0.1 metres to -1.2 metres of water equivalent per year, resulting in a global sea-level contribution of 335~{$\pm~$}144 gigatonnes, or 0.92~{$\pm~$}0.39 millimetres, per year. Although statistical uncertainty ranges overlap, our conclusions suggest that glacier mass loss may be larger than previously reported11. The present glacier mass loss is equivalent to the sea-level contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet12, clearly exceeds the loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet13, and accounts for 25~to~30 per cent of the total observed sea-level rise14. Present mass-loss rates indicate that glaciers could almost disappear in some mountain ranges in this century, while heavily glacierized regions will continue to contribute to sea-level rise beyond 2100.},
